## 2022-06-09

* **[Ruby Evolution](evolution.html)** bird-eye view added.

## 2022-01-05

* **[3.1](3.1.html)** changelog added. Better late than never, right?..

## 2020-12-25

* **[3.0](3.0.html)** changelog added!
* Documentation linking switched to docs.ruby-lang.org for good. Unfortunately, alternative sites are glitching with Ruby's everchanging docs formatting.

## 2019-12-27

* 2.7 changelog added!
* ~~In 2.7 changelog, links to docs _sometimes_ switched to "official" docs.ruby-lang.org website. Most of the time, we are linking to ruby-doc.org, which, while being unofficial, has two advantages: a) it looks a bit nicer and b) it doesn't mix what is in core and what came from standard libraries. Unfortunately, as of release date of 2.7, ruby-doc.org's rendering is unable to properly handle new core methods implemented in `.rb` files (compare GC docs on [official site](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/GC.html), and on [ruby-doc.org](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/GC.html))~~ ruby-doc.org was fixed!
* [Atom feed](feed.xml) added to the site, allowing to put it in your favorite aggregator _(yes, I am aware it is almost 2020 and nobody does this anymore)_.

## 2019-10-14

* 2.4 changelog added;
* 2.5 and 2.6 updated significantly with missing details/recent updates and mentions of upcoming (in 2.7) changes;
* "Highlights" added to the top of the each release with short (and subjective) list of the most visible changes;
* Book styles updated a bit for easier reading;
* More metainformation about each version added to its page (initial release date, current status, etc.).

## 2019-06-06

## 2018-12-29
