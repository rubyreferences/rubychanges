# Ruby 2.6

* **Released at:** Dec 25, 2018 ([NEWS](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/ruby_2_6/NEWS) file)
* **Status (as of <<date>>):** 2.6.6 is current _stable_
* **This document first published:** Dec 29, 2018
* **Last change to this document:** <<date>>

> **Note:** As already explained in [Introduction](README.md), this site is dedicated to changes in the **language**, not the **implementation**, therefore the list below lacks mentions of lots of important optimization introduced in 2.6, including the whole JIT big thing. That's not because they are not important, just because this site's goals are different.

## Highlights

* [Endless range](#endless-range-1)
* [`#then` "piping" method](#then-as-an-alias-for-yield_self)
* [Support for timezones in `Time`](#time-support-for-timezones)
* [`Proc` composition](#proc-composition)
* [Enumerator chaining](#enumerator-chaining)
* [`RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree`](#rubyvmabstractsyntaxtree)

## Language

### Endless range: `(1..)`

* **Discussion:** [Feature #12912](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12912)
* **Reason/Usage:** More convenient `Array` slicing, and idiomatic open-ended `case` conditions
* **Documentation:** [Range: Endless ranges](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Range.html#class-Range-label-Endless+Ranges)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  # Usage
  ary = %w[List of words]
  ary[2..] # => ["words"]

  case indicator
  when 1...8 then # ...
  when 8...15 then # ...
  when 15.. then # ...
  end

  years.grep(2017...)

  # Details of behavior:
  (1..).end         # => nil
  (1..).to_a        # RangeError (cannot convert endless range to an array)
  (1..).each { }    # hangs forever
  (1..) == (1...)   # => false
  (1..).size        # => Infinity
  ```
* **Follow-up:** "Beginless" range [was introduced](2.7.html#beginless-range) in 2.7.

### Non-ASCII constant names

Constant names may start with a non-ASCII capital letter.

* **Discussion:** [Feature #13770](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13770)
* **Reason:** Why not?

### `else` in exception-handling context

In exception-handling context, `else` without any `rescue` is now a syntax error

* **Discussion:** [Feature #14606](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14606)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  # In Ruby 2.6 it would be SyntaxError: else without rescue is useless
  [1,2,3].each do
    p :foo
  else
    p :bar
  end
  ```
  The code above obviously contains some error (omitted `if` or something), but before Ruby 2.6 the interpreter would not complain, interpreting it as "begin → perform code that might raise → else (if nothing was raised) performing something", due to lesser-used Ruby feature of allowing `else` in an exception-handling construct.

### Refinements: improved visibility

Refinements are now compatible with `#public_send` and `#respond_to?`, and implicit `#to_proc`.

* **Reason:** This is part of the effort to make great yet neglected feature of refinements behave more naturally;
* **Discussions:** [Feature #14223](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14223), [Feature #15326](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15326), [Feature #15327](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15327)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  module StringExt
    refine String do
      def surround(before, after = before)
        after + self + before
      end

      def to_proc
        proc { |val| self % val }
      end
    end
  end

  using StringExt
  'foo'.respond_to?(:surround) # => true in 2.6, false in 2.5
  'foo'.public_send(:surround, '|') # => "|foo|" in 2.6, NoMethodError in 2.5
  (1..3).map(&'%02i') # => ["01", "02", "03"] in 2.6;  wrong argument type String (expected Proc) in 2.5
  ```
* **Follow-up:** Ruby 2.7 also made refinements available in [`#method`](2.7.html#refinements-in-methodinstance_method)

### Misc

* Infamous esoteric flip-flop syntax is deprecated finally: [Feature #5400](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/5400).
  * **Follow-up:** Deprecation is [reverted](2.7.html#warningsdeprecations) in 2.7

## Core classes and modules

### `Kernel`

_Notice that methods defined in `Kernel` are typically available on any object, that's why these changes are important._

#### `#then` as an alias for `#yield_self`

* **Reason:** Since the introduction of `Kernel#yield_self` at Ruby 2.5, it was pointed out that the name chosen is too long for this basic method, and, unlike most of other core methods, says "how it is implemented" not the intention; after lots of discussion it was decided `#then` corresponds best to the method's goal.
* **Notice:** There is a controversy in the community about this alias, pointing out the fact that `#then` is a typical method name for promises.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #14594](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14594)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  [BASE_URL, path].join('/')
      .then { |url| open(url).read }
      .then { |body| JSON.parse(body, symbolyze_names: true) }
      .dig(:data, :items)
      .then { |items| File.write('response.yml', items.to_yaml) }
  ```

#### `<Numeric>()` methods have `exception:` argument

* **Reason:** As of Ruby 2.5, `Integer('x')` will raise `ArgumentError (invalid value for Integer(): x)`, but in a lot of cases a sane thing to desire is "convert it, if possible"
* **Discussion:** [Feature #12732](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12732)
* **Affected methods:** `#Integer`, `#Float`, `#Rational`, `#Complex` and `#BigDecimal` (stdlib; previously known as `BigDecimal.new`)
* **Documentation:** [Kernel#Integer](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Kernel.html#method-i-Integer), [Kernel#Float](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Kernel.html#method-i-Float), [Kernel#Rational](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Kernel.html#method-i-Rational), [Kernel#Complex](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Kernel.html#method-i-Complex), [Kernel#BigDecimal](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.6/libdoc/bigdecimal/rdoc/Kernel.html#method-i-BigDecimal)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  Integer('x') # => ArgumentError (invalid value for Integer(): "x")
  Integer('x', exception: false) # => nil
  ```

#### `#system` has `exception:` argument

With `exception: true`, the method raises instead of returning `false` on non-0 exit code, or `nil` on command execution failure.

* **Discussion:** [Feature #14386](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14386)
* **Documentation:** [Kernel#system](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Kernel.html#method-i-system) (unfortunately, seems documentation haven't been updated with new feature)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  system('cat nonexistent.txt')  # => false
  system('ctat nonexistent.txt') # => nil

  system('cat nonexistent.txt', exception: true)  # RuntimeError (Command failed with exit 1: cat)
  system('ctat nonexistent.txt', exception: true) # Errno::ENOENT (No such file or directory - ctat)

  ```

### `Module#method_defined?`: `inherit` argument

`Module#method_defined?` and similar methods accept an optional second argument. If it is `false`, only module's own methods would be returned.

* **Reason:** Other module introspection methods, like `#methods`, already have similar arguments. It may be important for meta-programming; like "when this module is included, it will redefine some host's methods, but only those that belong to host", or "test that all descendants of some abstract class redefine required methods".
* **Affected methods:** `#method_defined?`, `#private_method_defined?`, `#protected_method_defined?`, `#public_method_defined?`.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #14944](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14944)
* **Documentation:** [Module#method_defined?](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Module.html#method-i-method_defined-3F), [Module#private_method_defined?](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Module.html#method-i-private_method_defined-3F), [Module#protected_method_defined?](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Module.html#method-i-protected_method_defined-3F), [Module#public_method_defined?](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Module.html#method-i-public_method_defined-3F)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  Array.method_defined?(:chunk)
  # => true
  Array.method_defined?(:chunk, false)
  # => false -- it is Enumerable's method
  Array.method_defined?(:to_h, false)
  # => true  -- despite inheriting from Enumerable, Array redefines it for performance
  ```
* **Follow-up:** In 2.7, `inherit` argument was also [added to `autoload?`](2.7.html#autoload-inherit-argument)

### `String#split` with block

* **Reason:** When parsing a huge string, and each substring is used exactly once, it could be ineffective to first create the whole array of parts, and only then iterate through it; with block form, parts are just yielded one by one;
* **Discussion:** [Feature #4780](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/4780)
* **Documentation:** [String#split](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/String.html#method-i-split)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  "several\nlong\nlines".split("\n") { |part| puts part if part.start_with?('l') }
  # prints:
  #   long
  #   lines
  # => "several\nlong\nlines"
  ```
  Note that in block form, the _original string_ will be returned, not the result of processing parts with block. To work with split results in a method-chaining style, one can utilize `Object#to_enum`:
  ```ruby
  "several\nlong\nlines"
    .to_enum(:split, "\n")  # => Makes a enumerator, yielding each entry from split("\n")
    .each_with_object(Hash.new(0)) { |ln, h| h[ln.length] += 1 }
    # => {7=>1, 4=>1, 5=>1}
  ```

### `Time`: support for timezones

The concept of a "timezone object" is introduced for various `Time` methods. Ruby does not define any timezone classes by itself, but the API expected corresponds to that of [TZInfo::Timezone](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/tzinfo/TZInfo/Timezone):

> A timezone argument must have `local_to_utc` and `utc_to_local` methods, and may have `name` and `abbr` methods.

* **Methods affected:**
  * `.new` (timezone may be passed as a last argument, which previously accepted only raw UTC offsets)
  * `.at` (new keyword `in:` argument)
  * `#getlocal` (accepts timezone where previously only UTC offset was accepted)
  * `#+`, `#-`, `#succ` (no new argument, but preserve timezone of the source)
* **Discussion:** [Feature #14850](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14850)
* **Documentation:** [Time: Timezone argument](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Time.html#class-Time-label-Timezone+argument)
* **Reason:** Named timezones are more complicated than just "offset from UTC". Going over DST date, or between different years in country history, time could have the same timezone, but different UTC offset.
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  require 'tzinfo'
  tz = TZInfo::Timezone.get('America/New_York')
  t = Time.new(2018, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0, tz)
  t.utc_offset # => -14400, -4 hours
  t += 6 * 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 # + 6 months
  t.utc_offset # => -18000, -5 hours
  ```

### `Proc` composition

`Proc` and `Method` classes now have `#>>` and `#<<` methods for functional composition.

* **Reason:** This was a long-anticipated feature for moving Ruby towards more functional code.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #6284](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/6284)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  plus = ->(x, y) { x + y }
  mul2 = ->(x) { x * 2 }
  stringify = :to_s.to_proc

  (plus >> mul2).call(5, 6)
  # => 22
  (mul2 >> stringify).call(5) # (5 * 2).to_s
  # => "10"
  (mul2 << stringify).call(5) # 5.to_s * 2
  # => "55"

  # Realistic examples:

  # 1. Providing chain of functions instead of chaining map's:
  URLS.map(&Faraday.method(:get) >> :body.to_proc >> JSON.method(:parse) >> ->(data) { data.dig('response', 'items')})

  # 2. Storing chain of processings in constant:
  RESPONSE_PROCESSOR = Faraday.method(:get) >>
                      :body.to_proc >>
                      JSON.method(:parse) >>
                      ->(data) { data.dig('response', 'items')}

  # ...later...
  URLS.map(&RESPONSE_PROCESSOR)

  # 3. Utilizing block-based DSLs (Sinatra-alike)
  get '/my_endpoint', &parse_params >> perform_business_action >> render_response
  ```
* **Important notice**: Unlike any other places in Ruby (where objects are coerced into procs with `#to_proc` method), "what can be chained" is decided by existence of `#call` method; this means you CAN'T chain symbols (notice `:body.to_proc` above), but CAN chain some "command pattern" classes with `MyClass.call` API.

### `Array#union` and `Array#difference`

`Array#union` is like `|`, but also accepts multiple arguments; `Array#difference` is like `-`, but accepts multiple arguments.

* **Discussion:** [Feature #14097](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14097)
* **Reason:** Multiple-argument methods are more effective, and better chainable than operator form
* **Documentation:** [Array#union](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Array.html#method-i-union), [Array#difference](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Array.html#method-i-difference)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  [1, 2, 3].union([3, 4], [4, 5])
  # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  [1, 2, 3, 4].difference([3, 4], [1])
  # => [2]
  ```
* **Notice:** There are also plans (discussed in the same ticket above) to introduce mutating `union!` form.
* **Follow-up:** Ruby 2.7 [added](2.7.html#arrayintersection) `#intersection` method.

### `Hash#merge` with multiple arguments

* **Discussion:** [Feature #15111](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15111)
* **Methods affected:** `Hash#merge`, `Hash#merge!`, `Hash#update` (alias for `#merge!`)
* **Documentation:** [Hash#merge](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Hash.html#method-i-merge)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  {a: 1, b: 2}.merge({b: 3, c: 4}, {c: 5, b: 6}) # => {a: 1, b: 6, c: 5}

  {a: 1, b: 2}.merge({b: 3, c: 4}, {c: 5, b: 6}) { |key, oldval, newval| [oldval, newval] }
  # => {a: 1, b: [[2, 3], 6], c: [4, 5]}
  ```
  Note the last example: if the block is provided for conflict resolution, it is called repeatedly for **each pair** of values provided for the conflicting key (not `|key, *all_conflicting_values|` as one may expect).

### Enumerables

#### `#filter`/`#filter!`

`#select` is aliased as `#filter` (and `#select!` as `#filter!`, where applicable).

* **Reason:** It was argued for a long time that most of other languages name the concept "filter", so the new alias was added to lessen the confusion for newcomers.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #13784](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13784)
* **Classes and modules affected:** `Enumerable`, `Enumerator`, `Enumerator::Lazy`, `Struct` (only `#filter`), `Array`, `Hash`, and `Set` of standard library (`#filter` and `#filter!`).

#### `#to_h` with a block

* **Reason:** It was noted that `.map { |...| [some_key, some_value] }.to_h` is a very common pattern and should be made DRY;
* **Discussion:** [Feature #15143](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15143);
* **Classes and modules affected:** `Enumerable` and everything that includes it;
* **Documentation:** [Enumerable#to_h](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Enumerable.html#method-i-to_h), [Array#to_h](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Array.html#method-i-to_h), [ENV.to_h](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/ENV.html#method-c-to_h), [Hash#to_h](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Hash.html#method-i-to_h), [Struct#to_h](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Struct.html#method-i-to_h)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}.to_h { |k, v| [k.to_s, -v] } # => {'a' => -1, 'b' => -2, 'c' => -3}
  File.readlines('test.txt').each_with_index.to_h { |l, i| [i, l] }
  # => {0 => 'first line', 1 => 'second line', 2 => 'third line'}
  ```

#### `Enumerator::ArithmeticSequence`

`Range#step` and `Numeric#step` are now returning not an instance of `Enumerator`, but `Enumerator::ArithmeticSequence` instead.

* **Reason/Usage:** This feature was added by request of scientific Ruby community; it is useful for reusing results of `(from..to).step(s)` as a value object for idiomatic slicing of custom collections, see also `Range#%`.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #13904](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13904)
* **Documentation:** [Enumerator::ArithmeticSequence](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.0.preview2/Enumerator/ArithmeticSequence.html), [Range#step](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Range.html#method-i-step), [Numeric#step](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Numeric.html#method-i-step)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  # Basic usage remains the same:
  (1..10).step(2).to_a
  # => [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

  enum = (1..10).step(2)
  # => ((1..10).step(2))
  enum.class
  # => Enumerator::ArithmeticSequence
  enum.class.ancestors
  # => [Enumerator::ArithmeticSequence, Enumerator, Enumerable ...]
  # So, it is just a specialized subclass of enumerator, adding this methods:
  enum.begin  # => 1
  enum.end    # => 10
  enum.step   # => 2
  ```
* **Follow-up:** In 3.0, `Array` slicing with `ArithmeticSequence` (from 1st to 10th, each 2nd element) [became possible](3.0.html#array-slicing-with-enumeratorarithmeticsequence).

#### `Enumerator` chaining

Several enumerators can now be chained into one with `Enumerator#+(other)` or `Enumerable#chain(list, of, enumerators)`. The result of the operation is `Enumerator::Chain` (specialized subclass of `Enumerator`).

* **Reason:** Cleaner expression of chaining enumeration for several sequences, especially for lazy enumerators
* **Discussion:** [Feature #15144](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15144)
* **Documentation:** [Enumerator#+](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Enumerator.html#method-i-2B), [Enumerable#chain](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Enumerable.html#method-i-chain), [Enumerator::Chain](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Enumerator/Chain.html)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  [1, 2, 3].chain
  # => #<Enumerator::Chain: [[1, 2, 3]]>
  [1, 2, 3].each + [4, 5, 6].each
  # => #<Enumerator::Chain: [#<Enumerator: [1, 2, 3]:each>, #<Enumerator: [4, 5, 6]:each>]>
  [1, 2, 3].chain([4, 5, 6])
  # => #<Enumerator::Chain: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]>

  # Realistic use-case:

  # Take data from several sources, abstracted into enumerator, fetching it on demand
  sources = URLS.lazy.map { |url| open(url).read }
    .chain(LOCAL_FILES.lazy.map { |path| File.read(path) })

  # ...then uniformely search several sources (lazy-loading them) for some value
  sources.detect { |body| body.include?('Ruby 2.6') }
  ```

### `Range`

#### `Range#===` uses `#cover?` instead of `#include?`

* **Reason:** Previously, case equality operator used `#include?`, which underneath iterates through entire range (except for Numerics). With objects other than numbers it could be ineffective (creating thousands of objects), impossible (if there is no notion of "next object", but exists notion of order) or imprecise.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #14575](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14575)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  case DateTime.now
  when Date.today..Date.today + 1
    # this would've not been reached before Ruby 2.6
  end

  # this would raise "can't iterate from Gem::Version" before Ruby 2.6
  case Gem::Version.new('2.4')
  when Gem::Version.new('1.8.7')..Gem::Version.new('2.5')
  end

  gem 'ruby-ip'
  require 'ip'
  # this would perform ~0.5 sec before Ruby 2.6, iterating over 65536-elt sequence
  case IP.new('192.168.10.4')
  when IP.new('192.168.0.0')..IP.new('192.168.255.255')
  end
  ```
* **Notice:** For `String` ranges, behavior left unchanged, so example with versions above would NOT work with pure-`String` versions.
* **Follow-up:** `String` behavior was [fixed](2.7.html#for-string) in Ruby 2.7, so in 2.7 this code prints "yes":
  ```ruby
  case '2.5'
  when '1.8.7'..'2.6'
    puts "yes"
  else
    puts "no"
  end
  ```

#### `Range#cover?` accepts range argument

* **Discussion:** [Feature #14473](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14473)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  (1..5).cover?(2..3) # => true
  ```

#### `Range#%` alias

* **Reason/Usage:** It was proposed to have short syntax of complex array slicing, usable for math algorithms; see also `Enumerable::ArithmeticSequence`.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #14697](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14697)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  (5..20) % 2
  # => ((5..20).%(2)) -- an instance of Enumerable::ArithmeticSequencee

  some_fancy_collection[(5..20) % 2] # each second element in 5..20 range
  ```
  Note that `()` around the range is mandatory here, because `5..20 % 2` will be parsed as `(5)..(20 % 2)`
* **Notice:** Ruby's `Array` doesn't support slicing with `Enumerable::ArithmeticSequencee` as of 2.6.
* **Follow-up:** In 3.0, `Array` slicing with `ArithmeticSequence` [became possible](3.0.html#array-slicing-with-enumeratorarithmeticsequence).

### Exceptions

#### New arguments: `receiver:` and `key:`

`NameError`, `NoMethodError` accept `:receiver` on creation; `KeyError` accepts `:receiver` and `:key`.

* **Reason:** Since Ruby 2.5, these exception classes were "introspectable": when you catch them, you can fetch the object that caused the problem and (in case of `KeyError`) problematic key; but there were no way to add that helpful data when raising an exception in your own code.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #14313](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14313)
* **Documentation:** [NameError::new](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/NameError.html#method-c-new), [NoMethodError::new](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/NoMethodError.html#method-c-new) _(docs not updated)_, [KeyError::new](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/KeyError.html#method-c-new)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  class MyFancyCollection
    def [](key)
      # ...
      raise KeyError.new("don't have this: #{key}", receiver: self, key: key)
      # ...
    end
  end
  ```
* **Notice:** `<Exception>.new` syntax is the only way to pass new arguments, this would **not** work:
  ```ruby
  raise KeyError, "don't have this: #{key}", receiver: self, key: key
  ```
* **Follow-up:** Ruby 2.7 [adds](2.7.html#frozenerror-receiver-argument) `receiver:` argument for `FrozenError`, too.

#### `Exception#full_message` options

`Exception#full_message` (which returns "exceptions how they are printed by Ruby", including message, class and backtrace) takes `:highlight` and `:order` options. This means client code can fine-tune which result it wants to achieve.

* **Reason:** Since introduction of new way for printing exceptions to STDERR (backtrace in reverse order and message is highlighted in bold), there were some improvements proposed to handle different contexts of exception printing.
* **Discussion:** [Bug #14324](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14324)
* **Documentation:** [Exception#full_message](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Exception.html#method-i-full_message)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  begin
    {a: 1}.fetch(:b)
  rescue => e
    # highlight: true/false, order: :top/:bottom
    p e.full_message(highlight: false, order: :top)
    # "t.rb:2:in `fetch': key not found: :b (KeyError)\n\tfrom t.rb:2:in `<main>'\n"
    p e.full_message(highlight: true, order: :bottom)
    # "\e[1mTraceback\e[m (most recent call last):\n\t1: from t.rb:2:in `<main>'\nt.rb:2:in `fetch': \e[1mkey not found: :b (\e[1;4mKeyError\e[m\e[1m)\e[m\n"
    p e.full_message
    # Output could be either of two above, depending on whether STDERR is terminal
    # or redirected with `ruby test.rb 2> err.log
  end
  ```

#### Exception output tweaking

* `Exception#cause` is now printed if STDERR is the terminal:
  ```ruby
  begin
    {a: 1}.fetch(:b)
  rescue => e
    raise 'something went wrong'
  end
  # Traceback (most recent call last):
  #   1: from t.rb:2:in `<main>'
  # t.rb:2:in `fetch': key not found: :b (KeyError)
  #   1: from t.rb:1:in `<main>'
  # t.rb:4:in `rescue in <main>': something went wrong (RuntimeError)
  ```
  Notice the exception that led to `rescue`/`raise` block (`KeyError`) is printed too.
  * **Discussion**: [Feature #8257](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/8257)
* Exception backtrace and error message are printed in reverse order when the exception is not caught and STDOUT is unchanged and a tty. [Feature #8661](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/8661)
  * **Follow-up:** [Reverted completely](3.0.html#exception-output-order-is-changed----again) to pre-2.5 order in 3.0.

### Filesystem and IO

#### `Dir#each_child` and `Dir#children`

* **Discussion:** [Feature #13969](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13969)
* **Documentation:** [Dir#each_child](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Dir.html#method-i-each_child), [Dir#children](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Dir.html#method-i-children)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  Dir.new('.').children
  # => ["_layouts", ".gitignore", "README.md", "_data", "_src", "_site", "_config.yml", "2.6.md", "js", "404.html", ".git", "images", "Gemfile", "css", "Gemfile.lock"]

  ```

#### IO open mode: `'x'`

When opening a new file for writing, `'wx'` can be specified to request the file does not exist before opening.

* **Discussion:** [Feature #11258](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/11258)
* **Documentation:** [IO: Open mode](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/IO.html#method-c-new-label-IO+Open+Mode)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  f1 = File.open('temp.txt', 'wx')
  # => #<File:temp.txt>
  f2 = File.open('temp.txt', 'wx') # it is already created by previous statement
  # Errno::EEXIST (File exists @ rb_sysopen - temp.txt)
  ```

### Minor changes

* `Object#=~` is deprecated: [Feature #15231](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15231) (but `NilClass#=~` is still allowed without deprecation notice).
* `Random.bytes`: [Feature #4938](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/4938) / [Random.bytes](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Random.html#method-c-bytes)
  ```ruby
  Random.bytes(5)
  # => "8\a\xB0\xD1V"
  # ...will probably return different value for you, though :)
  ```

### Introspection

#### `Binding#source_location`

* **Reason:** Important usage for this new feature is proper reporting in block-based DSL usage: if something was inconsistent in the passed block, library code may use `block.binding.source_location` to report _where exactly_ problematic code came from.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #14230](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14230)
* **Documentation:** [Binding#source_location](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Binding.html#method-i-source_location)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  binding.source_location
  # => ["(irb)", 114]

  def my_dsl(&block)
    puts "Evaluating block from #{block.binding.source_location.join(':')}"
  end

  my_dsl { ... } # Prints "Evaluating block from (irb):118"
  ```

#### `RubyVM.resolve_feature_path`

For string `name`, returns what path `require(name)` will load (without actually loading it).

* **Reason:** Static analysis of the program (finding the code it will use without really loading it); understanding where dependencies are coming from.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #15230](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15230)
* **Documentation:** —
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  RubyVM.resolve_feature_path('net/http')
  # => [:rb, "<...>/ruby-2.6.0/lib/ruby/2.6.0/net/http.rb"]
  RubyVM.resolve_feature_path('syslog')
  # => [:so, "<...>/ruby-2.6.0/lib/ruby/2.6.0/x86_64-linux/syslog.so"]
  RubyVM.resolve_feature_path('garbage')
  # LoadError (cannot load such file -- garbage)
  require 'net/http'
  RubyVM.resolve_feature_path('net/http')
  # => [:rb, false]  -- for already loaded libraries, the path would not be returned

  # For gems:
  RubyVM.resolve_feature_path('faraday')
  # LoadError (cannot load such file -- faraday)
  gem 'faraday' # without this, gems can not be deduced
  RubyVM.resolve_feature_path('faraday')
  # => [:rb, "<...>/gems/faraday-0.15.4/lib/faraday.rb"]
  ```
* **Follow-up:** In Ruby 2.7, `resolve_feature_path` was [moved](2.7.html#load_pathresolve_feature_path) to a `$LOAD_PATH` singleton method, and its behavior for already loaded pathes was [fixed](2.7.html#resolve_feature_path-behavior-for-loaded-features-fixed) to return path nevertheless.

#### `RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree`

The new module provides an "official" Ruby parser, replacing stdlib Ripper (and third-party parsers). The module is considered experimental, and its API can change in the future versions.

* **Documentation:** [RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/RubyVM/AbstractSyntaxTree.html)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  tree = RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree.parse('1+2')
  # => #<RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree::Node(SCOPE(0) 1:0, 1:3): >
  tree.type
  # => :SCOPE
  tree.children
  # => [[], nil, #<RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree::Node(OPCALL(36) 1:0, 1:3): >]
  tree.children[2].type
  # => :OPCALL
  tree.children[2].children
  # => [#<RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree::Node(LIT(59) 1:0, 1:1): >, :+, #<RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree::Node(ARRAY(42) 1:2, 1:3): >]
  tree.children[2].children[0].children
  # => [1]
  ```
* **Notice:** One may be excited about `RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree.of(proc)`, but it doesn't mean the "real" extraction of code from live `Proc`, rather a simple hack with trying to find proc's source file and parse it.

### `TracePoint` improvements

Ruby [TracePoint](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/TracePoint.html) API allows to observe any events that are happening during program evaluation. In 2.6, there were several improvements to allow better control on event handling and their introspection.

#### `#parameters`

On `:b_call` and `:c_call` (block and method call events), `TracePoint` now provides `#parameters` method to fetch call params definitions.

* **Discussion:** [Feature #14694](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14694)
* **Documentation:** [TracePoint#parameters](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/TracePoint.html#method-i-parameters)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  t = TracePoint.new(:b_call) { |tp| p [tp.event, tp.parameters] }
  t.enable

  [1, 2, 3].map { |x| x.to_s }
  # [:b_call, [[:opt, :x]]]
  # [:b_call, [[:opt, :x]]]
  # [:b_call, [[:opt, :x]]]
  ```
* **Notice:** Format of return value is the same as for [Method#parameters](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/Method.html#method-i-parameters)

#### `:script_compiled` event

Event fired when a new piece of Ruby code is loaded (through `eval`, `require` or `load`). `#instruction_sequence` on this event will return compiled [RubyVM::InstructionSequence](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/RubyVM/InstructionSequence.html) object, and `#eval_script` will return the text of the script sent to `eval`.

* **Discussion:** [Feature #15287](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15287)
* **Documentation:** [TracePoint: Events](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/TracePoint.html#class-TracePoint-label-Events) (though new event seems to be omitted), [TracePoint#instruction_sequence](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/TracePoint.html#method-i-instruction_sequence), [TracePoint#eval_script](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/TracePoint.html#method-i-eval_script)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  t = TracePoint.new(:script_compiled) { |tp| p [tp.event, tp.instruction_sequence, tp.eval_script] }
  t.enable

  eval('p 1')
  # [:script_compiled, <RubyVM::InstructionSequence:<main>@(eval):1>, "p 1"]
  require 'net/http'
  # [:script_compiled, <RubyVM::InstructionSequence:<top (required)>@.../ruby-2.6.0/lib/ruby/2.6.0/net/http.rb:0>, nil]
  # [:script_compiled, <RubyVM::InstructionSequence:<top (required)>@.../ruby-2.6.0/lib/ruby/2.6.0/net/protocol.rb:0>, nil]
  # [:script_compiled, <RubyVM::InstructionSequence:<top (required)>@.../ruby-2.6.0/lib/ruby/2.6.0/socket.rb:0>, nil]
  # .....
  ```

#### `#enable`: new params `target:` and `target_line:`

With new parameters provided, you can fine-tune for what methods or specific lines to catch events.

* **Reason:** Less trace garbage and performance footprint on tracing in complex codebase, allowing very specific tracepoints to be enabled even in production.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #15289](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15289).
* **Documentation:** [TracePoint#enable](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/TracePoint.html#method-i-enable) (not much, though...)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  t = TracePoint.new(:line) { |tp| p tp }

  def m1
    p 1
  end

  def m2
    p 2
  end

  t.enable(target: method(:m1))

  m1
  # prints #<TracePoint:line@test.rb:5 in `m1'>
  m2
  # prints nothing
  ```
* **Notice:** In absence of docs, we can at least point at [commit message](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby-trunk/repository/revisions/66003):
  > `code` should be consisted of `InstructionSequence` (iseq) (`RubyVM::InstructionSequence.of(code)` should not return nil). If code is a tree of iseq, `TracePoint` is enabled on all of iseqs in a tree.

## Standard library

* **Bundler is added to Standard Library:** [Feature #12733](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12733).
* `Kernel#BigDecimal()` method now accepts `exception:` argument (see [above](#numeric-methods-have-exception-argument) for explanations)
* `URI` now can open `file://` URIs, `URI::File` class added.
  * **Documentation:** [URI::File](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.6/libdoc/uri/rdoc/URI/File.html)
  * **Discussion:** [Feature #14035](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14035)

### Libraries promoted to default gems

> **[stdgems.org](https://stdgems.org/)** project has a nice explanations of default and bundled gems concepts, as well as a list of currently gemified libraries.

"For the rest of us" this means libraries development extracted into separate GitHub repositories, and they are just packaged with main Ruby before release. It means you can do issue/PR to any of them independently, without going through more tough development process of the core Ruby.

Libraries extracted in 2.6:

* [e2mmap](https://github.com/ruby/e2mmap)
* [forwardable](https://github.com/ruby/forwardable)
* [irb](https://github.com/ruby/irb)
* [logger](https://github.com/ruby/logger)
* [matrix](https://github.com/ruby/matrix)
* [mutex_m](https://github.com/ruby/mutex_m)
* [ostruct](https://github.com/ruby/ostruct)

* [tracer](https://github.com/ruby/tracer)

**Follow-up:**
* [16 more libraries](2.7.html#libraries-promoted-to-default-gems) gemified in 2.7, and [6 just dropped](2.7.html#libraries-excluded-from-the-standard-library) from the standard library;
* [34 (!) more libraries](3.0.html#libraries-promoted-to-default-gems) gemified in 3.0, and [3 more just dropped](3.0.html#libraries-promoted-to-default-gems) from the standard library (including webrick).
