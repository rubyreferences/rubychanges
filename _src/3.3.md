### `Array#pack` and `String#unpack`: raise `ArgumentError` for unknown directives

* **Discussion:** [Bug #19150]
* **Documentation:** [doc/packed_data.rdoc](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/packed_data_rdoc.html)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  [1, 2, 3].pack('r*')
  # Ruby 3.1: "", no warning
  # Ruby 3.2: "", warning: unknown pack directive 'r' in 'r*'
  # Ruby 3.3: in `pack': unknown pack directive 'r' in 'r*' (ArgumentError)
  ```
* **Notes:**

### `Dir.for_fd` and `Dir.fchdir`

Two methods to accept an integer file descriptor as an argument: `for_fd` creates a `Dir` object from it; `fchdir` changes the current directory to one specified by a descriptor.

* **Reason:** New methods allow to use UNIX file descriptors if they are returned from a C-level code or obtained from OS.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #19347]
* **Documentation:** [Dir.for_fd](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Dir.html#method-c-for_fd), [Dir.fchdir](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Dir.html#method-c-fchdir)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  fileno = Dir.new('doc/').fileno
  # In reality, this #fileno might come from other library

  dir = Dir.for_fd(fileno)
  #=> #<Dir:0x00007f8831b810a8> -- no readable path representation
  dir.path #=> nil
  dir.to_a
  #=> ["forwardable.rd.ja", "packed_data.rdoc", "marshal.rdoc", "format_specifications.rdoc", ....
  # It was performed in the Ruby's core folder, and lists the doc/ contents

  # Attempt to use a bogus fileno will result in error:
  Dir.for_fd(0)
  # `for_fd': Not a directory - fdopendir (Errno::ENOTDIR)

  # Same with fileno that doesn't designate a directory:
  Dir.for_fd(Dir.new('README.md').fileno)
  # in `initialize': Not a directory @ dir_initialize - README.md (Errno::ENOTDIR)

  # Same logic works for .fchdir
  Dir.fchdir(fileno) #=> 0
  Dir.pwd
  #=> "/home/zverok/projects/ruby/doc" -- the current path have changed successfully

  # A block form of fchdir is available, like for a regular .chdir:
  Dir.fchdir(Dir.new('NEWS').fileno) do
    p Dir.pwd #=> "/home/zverok/projects/ruby/doc/NEWS"
  end
  Dir.pwd #=> "/home/zverok/projects/ruby/doc" -- back to the path before the block
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * The functionality is only supported on POSIX platforms;
  * The initial [ticket](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19347) only proposed to find a way to be able to change a current directory to one specified by a descriptor (i.e., what eventually became `.fchdir`), but during the discussion a need were discovered for a generic instantiation of a `Dir` instance from the descriptor (what became `from_fd`), as well as a generic way to change the current directory to one specified by `Dir` instance ([`#chdir`](TODO), which is not related to descriptors but is generically useful).

### `Dir#chdir`

An instance method version of [Dir.chdir](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Dir.html#method-c-chdir): changes the current working directory to one specified by the `Dir` instance.

* **Discussion:** [Feature #19347]
* **Documentation:** [Dir#chdir](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Dir.html#method-i-chdir)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  Dir.pwd #=> "/home/zverok/projects/ruby"
  dir = Dir.new('doc')
  dir.chdir #=> nil
  Dir.pwd #=> "/home/zverok/projects/ruby/doc"

  # The block form works, too:
  Dir.new('NEWS').chdir do
    Dir.pwd #=> "/home/zverok/projects/ruby/doc/NEWS"
  end
  Dir.pwd #=> "/home/zverok/projects/ruby/doc"
  ```

### `MatchData#named_captures`: `symbolize_names:` argument

* **Discussion:** [Feature #19591]
* **Documentation:** [MatchData#named_captures](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/MatchData.html#method-i-named_captures)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  m = "2023-12-25".match(/(?<year>\d{4})-(?<month>\d{2})-(?<day>\d{2})/)
  m.named_captures
  #=> {"year"=>"2023", "month"=>"12", "day"=>"25"}
  m.named_captures(symbolize_names: true)
  #=> {:year=>"2023", :month=>"12", :day=>"25"}
  ```
* **Notes:** While `symbolize_names:` might looks somewhat strange (usually we talk about hash _keys_), it is done for consistency with Ruby standard library's [`JSON.parse`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/JSON.html#module-JSON-label-Output+Options) signature, which inherited the terminology from the JSON specification.

### `Module#set_temporary_name`

Allows to assign a string to be rendered as class/module's `#name`, without assigning the class/module to a constant.

* **Reason:** The feature is useful to provide reasonable representation for dynamically auto-generated classes without assigning them to constants (which pollutes the global namespace and might conflict with existing constants) or redefining `Class#name` (which might break other code and not always respected in the output).
* **Discussion:** [Feature #19521]
* **Documentation:** [Module#set_temporary_name](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Module.html#method-i-set_temporary_name)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
dynamic_class = Class.new do
  def foo; end
end

dynamic_class.name #=> nil

# For dynamic classes, representation of related values is frequently unreadable:
dynamic_class #=> #<Class:0x0...>
instance = dynamic_class.new #=> #<#<Class:0x0...>:0x0...>
instance.method(:foo) #=> #<Method: #<Class:0x0...>#foo() ...>

dynamic_class::Nested = Module.new
dynamic_class::Nested #=> #<Class:0x0...>::Nested

# After assigning the temporary name, representation becomes more convenient:
dynamic_class.set_temporary_name("MyDSLClass(with description)")

dynamic_class #=> MyDSLClass(with description)
instance #=> #<MyDSLClass(with description):0x0...>
instance.method(:foo) #=> #<Method: MyDSLClass(with description)#foo() ...>

# Note that module constant names are assigned at the moment of their creation,
# and don't change when the temporary name is assigned:
dynamic_class::OtherNested = Module.new

dynamic_class::Nested #=> #<Class:0x0...>::Nested
dynamic_class::OtherNested #=> MyDSLClass(with description)::OtherNested

# Assigning names that correspond to constant name rules is prohibited:
dynamic_class.set_temporary_name("MyClass")
# `set_temporary_name': the temporary name must not be a constant path to avoid confusion (ArgumentError)
dynamic_class.set_temporary_name("MyClass::NestedName")
# `set_temporary_name': the temporary name must not be a constant path to avoid confusion (ArgumentError)

# When the module with a temporary name is put into a constant,
# it receives a permanent name, which can't be changed anymore
C = dynamic_class

# It affects all associated values (including modules)

dynamic_class #=> C
instance #=> #<C:0x0...>
instance.method(:foo) #=> #<Method: C#foo() ...>
dynamic_class::Nested #=> C::Nested
dynamic_class::OtherNested #=> C::OtherNested

dynamic_class.set_temporary_name("Can I have it back?")
# `set_temporary_name': can't change permanent name (RuntimeError)

# `nil` can be used to cleanup a temporary name:
other_class = Class.new
other_class.set_temporary_name("another one")
other_class #=> another one
other_class.set_temporary_name(nil)
other_class #=> #<Class:0x0...>
  ```
* **Notes:** Any phrase that used as a temporary name would be used verbatim; this might create very confusing `#inspect` results and error messages; so it is advised to use strings somehow implying that the name belong to a module. Imagine we wrap into classes with temporary names RSpec-style examples, and then there is a typo in such example:
  ```ruby
  it "works as a calculator" do
    expec(2+2).to eq 4
  end
  # If we assign just the example description as a temp.name, the
  # error would look like this:
  #
  #   undefined method `expec' for an instance of works as a calculator
  #                                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  #
  # ...which is confusing. So it is probably better to construct a
  # module-like temporary name, to have:
  #
  #   undefined method `expec' for an instance of MyFramework::Example("works as a calculator")
  #                                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  ```

### `ObjectSpace::WeakKeyMap`

A new "weak map" concept implementation. Unlike `ObjectSpace::WeakMap`, it compares keys by equality (`WeakMap` compares by identity), and only references to keys are weak (garbage-collectible).

* **Reason:** The idea of a new class grew out of increased usage of `ObjectSpace::WeakMap` (which was once considered internal). In many other languages, concept of "weak map" implies only key references are weak: this allows to use it as a generic "holder of some additional information related to a set of objects while they are alive," or just a weak set of objects (using them as keys and `true` as values): caches, deduplication sets, etc.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #18498]
* **Documentation:** [ObjectSpace::WeakKeyMap](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/ObjectSpace/WeakKeyMap.html)
* **Code:**
* **Notes:** The class interface is significantly leaner than `WeakMap`'s, and doesn't provide any kind of iteration methods (which is very hard to implement and use correctly with weakly-referenced objects), so the new class is more like a black box with associations than a collection.

### `ObjectSpace::WeakMap#delete`

* **Reason:** `WeakMap` is frequently used to have a loose list of objects that will need some processing at some point of program execution if they are still alive/used (that's why `WeekMap` and not `Array`/`Hash` is chosen in those cases). But it is possible that the code author wants to process objects conditionally, and to remove those which don't need processing anymore—even if they are still alive. `WeekMap` quacks like kind-of simple `Hash`, yet previously provided no way to delete keys.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #19561]
* **Documentation:** [ObjectSpace::WeakMap#delete](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/ObjectSpace/WeakMap.html#method-i-delete)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  files_to_close = ObjectSpace::WeakMap.new
  file1 = File.new('README.md')
  file2 = File.new('NEWS.md')

  files_to_close[file1] = true
  files_to_close[file2] = true

  files_to_close.delete(file1) #=> true

  # Attempt to delete non-existing key:
  files_to_close.delete(file1) #=> nil
  # An optional block can be provided in case the key doesn't exist:
  files_to_close.delete(file1) { puts "Already removed"; 0 }
  # Prints "Already removed", returns `0`

  # The block wouldn't be called if the deletion was effectful:
  files_to_close.delete(file2) { puts "Already removed"; 0 }
  # Prints nothing, returns true
  ```
* **Notes:**

### `Proc#dup` and `#clone` call `#initialize_dup` and `#initialize_copy`

* **Reason:** A fix for an old inconsistency: `Object`'s `#dup` and `#clone` methods docs
* **Discussion:** [Feature #19362]
* **Documentation:** — (Adheres to the behavior described for [Object#dup](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Object.html#method-i-dup) and [#clone](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Kernel.html#method-i-clone))
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  # The examples would work the same with
  # #dup/#initialize_dup and #clone/#initialize_copy
  class TaggedProc < Proc
    attr_reader :tag

    def initialize(tag)
      super()
      @tag = tag
    end

    def initialize_dup(other)
      @tag = other.tag
      super
    end
  end

  proc = TaggedProc.new('admin') { }

  proc.tag #=> 'admin'
  proc.dup.tag
  # Ruby 3.2 => nil, the duplication didn't went through initialize_dup
  # Ruby 3.3 => "admin"
  ```
* **Notes:** Inheriting from core classes is an advanced technique, and most of the times there are simple ways to achieve same goals (like wrapper objects containing a `Proc` and an additional info).

### `Process.warmup`

* **Reason:**
* **Discussion:** [Feature #18885]
* **Documentation:** [Process.warmup](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Process.html#method-c-warmup)
* **Code:**
* **Notes:**

### `Process::Status#&`  and `#>>` are deprecated

* **Reason:** These methods have been treating `Process::Status` as a very thin wrapper around an integer value of the return status of the process; which is unreasonable for supporting Ruby in more varying environments.
* **Discussion:** [Bug #19868]
* **Documentation:** [Process::Status#&](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Process/Status.html#method-i-26), [#>>](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Process/Status.html#method-i-3E-3E)
* **Code:**

### `Thread::Queue#freeze` and `SizedQueue#freeze` raise `TypeError`

* **Reason:** The discussion was started with a bug report about `Queue` not respecting `#freeze` in any way (`#push` and `#pop` were still working after `#freeze` call). It was then decided that allowing to freeze a queue like any other collection (leaving it immutable) would have questionable semantics: as `Queue` is meant to be an inter-thread communication utility, freezing a queue while some thread waits for it would either leave this thread hanging, or would require `#freeze`'s functionality to extend for communication with dependent threads. Neither is a good option, so the behavior of the method was changed to communicate that queue freezing doesn't make sense.
* **Discussion:** [Bug #17146]
* **Documentation:** [Thread::Queue#freeze](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Thread/Queue.html#method-i-freeze) and [Thread::SizedQueue#freeze](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Thread/SizedQueue.html#method-i-freeze)

### `Range#reverse_each`

Specialized `Range#reverse_each` method is implemented.

* **Reason:** Previously, `Range` didn't have a specialized `#reverse_each` method, so calling it would invoke a generic `Enumerable#reverse_each`. The latter works by  converting the object to array, and then enumerating this array. In case of a `Range` this can be inefficient (producing large arrays) or impossible (when only upper bound of the range is defined)
* **Discussion:** [Feature #18515]
* **Documentation:** [Range#reverse_each](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Range.html#method-i-reverse_each)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  (1..2**100).reverse_each.take(3)
  # Ruby 3.2: hangs on my machine, trying to produce an array
  # Ruby 3.3: #=> [1267650600228229401496703205376, 1267650600228229401496703205375, 1267650600228229401496703205374]
  #  (returns immediately)

  (...5).reverse_each.take(3)
  # Ruby 3.2: can't iterate from NilClass (TypeError)
  # Ruby 3.3: #=> [5, 4, 3]

  (1...).reverse_each
  # Ruby 3.2: hangs forever, trying to produce an array
  # Ruby 3.3: `reverse_each': can't iterate from NilClass (TypeError)

  # The latter change affects any type of range beginning:
  ('a'...).reverse_each
  # Ruby 3.2: hangs forever, trying to produce an array
  # Ruby 3.3: `reverse_each': can't iterate from NilClass (TypeError)
  ```
* **Notes:** Other than raising `TypeError` for endless ranges (which works with any type of range beginning), the specialized behavior is only implemented for `Integer`. A possibility of a generalization was [discussed](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18515#note-4) by using object's `#pred` method (opposite to `#succ`, which the range uses to iterate forward), but the scope of this change would be bigger, as currently only `Integer` implements such method. It is possible that the adjustments would be made in the future versions.

### `Refinement#refined_class` is renamed to `Refinement#target`

Just a renaming of the unfortunately named new method that [emerged in Ruby 3.2](/rubychanges/3.2.html#refinementrefined_class).

* **Discussion:** [Feature #19714]
* **Documentation:** [Refinement#target](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Refinement.html#method-i-target)

### `String#bytesplice`: new arguments to select a portion of the replacement string

The low-level string manipulation method now allows to provide a coordinates of the part of the replacement string to be used.

* **Reason:** The new "byte-oriented" methods [were introduced](https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/3.2.html#byte-oriented-methods) in Ruby 3.2 to support low-level programming like text editors or network protocol implementations. In those use cases, the necessity of copying of a small part of one string into the middle of another is frequent, and producing intermediate strings (by first slicing the necessary part) is costly.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #19314]
* **Documentation:** [String#bytesplice](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/String.html#method-i-bytesplice)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  # Base usage
  'foo'.byteplice(1..2, 'bar', 0..1)
  # The receiver is modified

  # Or, alternatively:
  'foo'.byteplice(1, 2, 'bar', 0, 1)

  # Two forms can't be mixed:
  'foo'.byteplice(1..2, 'bar', 0, 1)
  # Semi-open ranges work:
  'foo'.byteplice(1..2, 'bar', 1..)
  'foo'.byteplice(1..2, 'bar', ..1)

  ```

### `TracePoint` supports `:rescue` event

Allows to trace when some exception was `rescue`'d in the code of interest.

* **Discussion:** [Feature #19572]
* **Documentation:** [TracePoint#Events](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/TracePoint.html#class-TracePoint-label-Events)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  TracePoint.trace(:rescue) do |tp|
    puts "Exception rescued: #{tp.raised_exception.inspect} at #{tp.path}:#{tp.lineno}"
  end

  begin
    raise "foo"
  rescue => e
  end
  # Prints: "Exception rescued: #<RuntimeError: foo> at example.rb:7
  ```
* **Notes:** The event-specific attribute for the event is the same as for `:raise`: [#raised_exception](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/TracePoint.html#method-i-raised_exception).

### `Kernel#lambda` raises when passed `Proc` instance

* **Reason:** `lambda`'s goal is to create a lambda from provided literal block; in Ruby, it is impossible to change the "lambdiness" of the block once it is created. But `lambda(&proc_instance)` never notified users of that, which was confusing.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #19777]
* **Documentation:** [Kernel#lambda](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Kernel.html#method-i-lambda) _(no specific details are provided, though)_
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  # Intended usage:
  l = lambda { |a, b| a + b }
  l.lambda? #=> true
  l.parameters #=> [[:req, :a], [:req, :b]]

  # Unintended usage:
  p = proc { |a, b| a + b }

  # In Ruby 3.2 and below, it worked, but the produced value wasn't lambda:
  l = lambda(&p)
  l.parameters #=> [[:opt, :a], [:opt, :b]]
  l.lambda? #=> false
  l.object_id == p.object_id #=> true, it is just the same proc

  # Ruby 3.3:
  l = lambda(&p)
  # in `lambda': the lambda method requires a literal block (ArgumentError)

  # Despite the message about a "literal block," the method
  # works (though has no meaningful effect) with lambda-like Proc objects
  other_lambda = lambda { |a, b| a + b }
  lambda(&other_lambda) #=> works
  lambda(&:to_s) #=> works
  lambda(&method(:puts)) #=> works
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * The discussion was once [started](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15973) from the proposal to make `lambda` change "lambiness" of a passed block, but it raises multiple issues (changing the block semantics mid-program is just one of them). In general, `lambda` as a _method_ is considered legacy, inferior to the `-> { }` lambda literal syntax, exactly due to problems like this: it looks like a regular method that receives a block, and therefore should be able accept _any_ block, but in fact it is "special" method. So in 3.0, there was a warning about `lambda(&proc_instance)`, and since 3.3, the warning finally turned into an error.
  * There is exactly one occurrence in Ruby where block semantics _changes_ mid-flight:

### Deprecate subprocess creation with method dedicated to files

* **Reason:**
* **Discussion:** [Feature #19630]
* **Documentation:**
* **Affected methods:**
  * Kernel#open
  * URI.open
  * IO.binread
  * IO.foreach
  * IO.readlines
  * IO.read
  * IO.write
* **Code:**
* **Notes:**

### New `Warning` category: `:performance`

* **Reason:**
* **Discussion:** [Feature #19538]
* **Documentation:** [Warning#[category]](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Warning.html#method-c-5B-5D)
* **Code:**
* **Notes:**

### `Fiber#kill`

Terminates the Fiber by sending an exception inside it.

* **Reason:** The method is intended to be used to fibers that represent processes that need to be told explicitly to finalize themselves (invoking any `ensure` operations and cleanups that are necessary). If such fiber just abandoned and collected by a GC, it wouldn't invoke fiber's `ensure`, and therefore the resources wouldn't be cleaned; so there was need for a way to do this explicitly.
* **Discussion:** [Bug #595]
* **Documentation:** [Fiber#kill](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Fiber.html#method-i-kill)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby

  # Semi-realistic usage example:
  reader = Fiber.new do
    conn = SomeConnection.open(**params)
    while conn.open?
      Fiber.yield conn.read
    end
  ensure
    conn.close
  end

  headers = reader.resume # reads something from the connection
  body_line1 = reader.resume # reads some more
  # Now, if we want to explicitly stop reading and be sure that the connection
  # is closed, we might do this:
  reader.kill # invokes #ensure
  ```
* **Notes:**

### `Encoding#replicate` is removed

* **Reason:**
* **Discussion:** [Feature #18949]
* **Documentation:** —
* **Code:**
* **Notes:**

 added for checking if two ranges overlap. [[Feature #19839]]

### `Range#overlap?`

Checks for overlapping of two ranges.

* **Discussion:** [Feature #19839]
* **Documentation:** [Range#overlap?](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Range.html#method-i-overlap-3F)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  (1..3).overlap?(2..5) #=> true
  (1..3).overlap?(4..5) #=> false
  (..3).overlap?(3..)   #=> true

  (1...3).overlap?(3..5)
  #=> false, the first range doesn't include 3
  (1..3).overlap?(3...3)
  #=> false, the second range is empty (note it has an exclusive end)

  (1..3).overlap?('a'..'c')
  #=> false, ranges are incompatible (but not an exception)
  (1..3).overlap?(1)
  # `overlap?': wrong argument type Integer (expected Range) (TypeError)
  ```
* **Notes:** As documentation points out, the _technically empty_ `(...-Float::INFINITY)` range (nothing can be lower than `Float::INFINITY`, and it is not included) still considered overlapping with itself by this method:
  ```ruby
  (...-Float::INFINITY).overlap?(...-Float::INFINITY) #=> true
  # Same with other "nothing could be smaller" ranges:
  (..."").overlap?(..."") #=> true
  ```
  (Though, with Ruby's dynamic nature, one _technically can_ define an object that will report itself to be smaller than an empty string, and therefore belong to a range... Making it non-empty.)

### Standalone `it` in blocks will become anonymous argument in Ruby 3.4

In Ruby 3.3, it will just warn to prepare for a change.

* **Reason:** Numeric designation for anonymous bloc arguments (`_1`, `_2`, and so on) were considered ugly by many people, so after years of discussion, the `it` keyword is to be introduced on the next Ruby version; for now, it just warns _in places where it would be considered an anonymous block argument_.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #18980]
* **Code:** In the code below, where Ruby 3.3 currently produces a warning, Ruby 3.4 would treat `it` as an anonymous block argument; where Ruby 3.3 doesn't produce a warning, Ruby 3.4 would treat `it` as a local variable name or a method call (and would look for such names available in the scope).
  ```ruby
  # The cases that are warned:
  # warning: `it` calls without arguments will refer to the first block param in Ruby 3.4; use it() or self.it

  (1..3).map { it }      # inside a block without explicit parameters
  (1..3).map { it; _1 }  # ...even if numbered parameters are used, too
  def it; end
  (1..3).map { it }      # even if a method with name `it` exists in the scope

  # The cases that are not warned:

  it                        # not inside a block
  (1..3).map { |x| it }     # inside a block with named parameters
  (1..3).map { || it }      # ...even if they are empty
  (1..3).map { it() }       # with parentheses
  (1..3).map { it {} }      # with a block attached
  (1..3).map { it = 5; it } # if a local variable with the same name is created in the block
  it = 5
  (1..3).map { it }         # if a local variable with the same name is in the scope
  ```
* **Notes:** The new feature isn't expected to conflict with RSpec's [`it`](https://rspec.info/documentation/3.12/rspec-core/RSpec/Core/ExampleGroup.html#it-class_method), as calling that without any block attached is useless.
