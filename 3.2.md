* **Status (as of Feb 04, 2023):** 3.2.0 is current _stable_
* **This document first published:** Feb 4, 2022
* **Last change to this document:** Feb 04, 2023

<!--

-->

**ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ Before you start reading the changelog: A full-scale Russian invasion into my home country continues. The only reason I am alive and able to work on the changelog is Armed Force of Ukraine, and international support with weaponry, funds and information. I am in my home city Kharkiv, preparing to join the army. Please care to read two of my appeals to Ruby community before proceeding: [first](https://zverok.space/blog/2022-03-03-WAR.html), [second](https://zverok.space/blog/2022-03-15-STILL-WAR.html).<br/>We need all support we can get to push inviders out and to bring peace to our land. Please [spread information, lobby our cause and donate](https://war.ukraine.ua/).ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦**

> **Note:** As already explained in [Introduction](README.md), this site is dedicated to changes in the **language**, not the **implementation**, therefore the list below lacks mentions of lots of important optimization introduced in 3.2, including YJIT improvements and [object shapes](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18776). That's not because they are not important, just because this site's goals are different.

In preparation of this entry, [Cookpad's article](https://techlife.cookpad.com/entry/2022/12/26/121950) on notable changes in Ruby 3.2 written by core developers Koichi Sasada (ko1) and Yusuke Endoh (mame) provided invaluable insight. Thank you!

## Language changes[](#language-changes)

### Anonymous arguments passing improvements[](#anonymous-arguments-passing-improvements)

If the method declaration includes anonymous positional or keyword arguments (`*` or `**` without associated name), those arguments can now be passed to the next method with `some_method(*)` or `some_method(**)` syntax.

* **Reason:** While it can be considered too cryptic shorcut by some, the new feature is consistent with passing of _all_ arguments with `...`.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18351">Feature #18351</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/syntax/methods_rdoc.html#label-Array-2FHash+Argument">Methods: Array/Hash Argument</a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  def only_keywords(**) # accept keyword arguments
    p(**) # and pass them to the next method
  end

  def only_positional(*) # accept positional arguments
    p(*) # and pass them to the next method
  end

  def both(*, **) # effectively the same as ...
    p(*, **)
  end

  only_keywords(a: 1, b: 2)
  # prints "{:a=>1, :b=>2}"
  only_positional(1, 2, 3)
  # prints
  #  1
  #  2
  #  3
  both(1, 2, 3, a: :b)
  # prints
  #   1
  #   2
  #   3
  #   {:a=>:b}

  # Realistic usage: a small wrapper method, just "fall through" to the next one
  def get(url, **) = send_request(:get, url, **)

  # Named and unnamed could be freely mixed:
  def mixed_naming(*a, **)
    p a
    p(**)
  end

  mixed_naming(1, 2, 3, a: :b)
  # prints:
  #  [1, 2, 3]
  #  {:a=>:b}

  # But using anonymous forwarding with named arguments is an error
  def forward(*args) = p(*)
  # no anonymous rest parameter (SyntaxError)

  # Interestingly enough, not only calling methods, but also "repacking" values
  # into variables work:
  def repack(*, **)
    x = *       # this is syntax error
    x = [*]     # but this will work and put [1, 2] in x
    x, y = [*]  # and this will work and put 1 in x and 2 in y
    z = {**}    # this will put {a: :b} into z
  end
  repack(1, 2, a: :b)

  # While the latter example might seem just a curiosity, it could help with
  # quick debugging of path-through code.
  # Imagine the `get` method above fails in one particular case.
  # We can adjust it this way, temporarily:
  def get(url, **)
    binding.irb if {**}.dig(:headers, :content_type) == 'application/json'
    send_request(:get, url, **)
  end

  # Parentheses are important for correct parsing.
  # Imagine this:
  def test(*)
    # this, depending on further code, will be either a SyntaxError,
    # or interpreted as call_something() * next_statement
    call_something *
    # ...
  end

  # Procs don't support anonymous arguments:
  proc { |*| p(*) }
  # Somewhat confusingly, this definitions raises:
  #   no anonymous rest parameter (SyntaxError)
  # ...meaning surrounding method doesn't have them.

  # And if it does, they would be used, not proc's arguments:
  def test(*)
    proc { |*| p(*) }.call(1)
  end

  test(2)
  # prints 2 -- even inside proc, method's arguments are used for forwarding
  ```
* **Note:** Whether anonymous arguments should be supported in procs [is discussed](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19370).

### Constant assignment evaluation order changed[](#constant-assignment-evaluation-order-changed)

For a long time, statements like `module_expression::CONST_NAME = value_expression` first evaluated `value_expression` and then `module_expression`. This was changed to calculate `module_expression` first.

* **Reason:** Just making it consistent with other assignment expressions, which tend to calculate the left part before the right.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker bug" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15928">Bug #15928</a>
* **Documentation:** â€”
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  # synthetic demonstrational example:
  def make_a_class
    puts "Making a class"
    Class.new
  end

  make_a_class::CONST = 42.tap { puts "Calculating the value" }
  # Prints:
  #  In Ruby 3.1:
  #    Calculating the value
  #    Making a class
  #  In Ruby 3.2:
  #    Making a class
  #    Calculating the value

  # Even simpler:
  NonExistentModule::CONST = 42.tap { puts "Calculating the value" }
  # Ruby 3.1:
  #   Prints "Calculating the value"
  #   raises "uninitialized constant NonExistentModule" (NameError)
  # Ruby 3.2:
  #   just raises "uninitialized constant NonExistentModule" (NameError)
  ```
* **Note:** The problem is rarely relevant, but might eventually manifest itself in complicated metaprogramming or autoloading. Or, like in the last example, some effectful value might be calculated before discovering there is nowhere to put it in. According to discussion on the tracker, the old behavior was never intentional, it was just too hard to fix.

### Behavior of module reopening/redefinition with included modules changed[](#behavior-of-module-reopeningredefinition-with-included-modules-changed)

When some module/class name is available at the top level context from the included modules, and a new class/module is defined, previously it was considered a reopening of existing module; since Ruby 3.2, it is a creation of a new module.

* **Reason:** As one file's code has no control what is included in other files (may be non-obvious to code's author), cryptic behaviors might've emerged by treating included modules as reopenable on a top level.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18832">Feature #18832</a>
* **Documentation:** â€”
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  require 'net/http'

  # ...might've happened in some of required files
  include Net

  p HTTP
  #=> Net::HTTP -- from included Net module

  # plan to define some of our app-specific HTTP services here
  module HTTP
    # ...
  end
  # Ruby 3.1: HTTP is not a module (TypeError)
  #   Because it assumes you reopening HTTP class from included Net
  #   The error is hard to understand and even harder to bypass
  # Ruby 3.2: Successfully defines a new empty module, unrelated to Net::HTTP

  p HTTP
  #=> HTTP -- now it is a new module,
  #           and Net::HTTP is available only by fully-qualified name
  ```

### Keyword argument separation leftovers[](#keyword-argument-separation-leftovers)

A few edge cases after [big keyword argument separation](3.0.html#keyword-arguments-are-now-fully-separated-from-positional-arguments) were fixed:

* Erroneous autosplatting of positional arguments in procs. Discussion: <a class="tracker bug" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18633">Bug #18633</a>
  ```ruby
  test = proc { |arg, **keywords| p(arg:, keywords:) }
  test.call(1, 2)
  # Prints: {:arg=>1, :keywords=>{}}, 2 is lost as an extra argument, as expected
  # But...
  test.call([1, 2])
  # Ruby 3.1: prints {:arg=>1, :keywords=>{}}, extra unexpected splatting & loss of 2s
  # Ruby 3.2: prints {:arg=>[1, 2], :keywords=>{}}, as expected
  ```
* The methods that splat arguments were fixed to consistently treat keyword arguments according to `ruby2_keywords` tag. Discussion: <a class="tracker bug" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18625">Bug #18625</a>, <a class="tracker bug" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16466">Bug #16466</a>
  ```ruby
  def method_with_keywords(**kw) = p kw

  # This should never work: method is not marked with ruby2_keywords,
  # so it shouldn't ever unpack positional arguments into keyword arguments.
  def method_with_positional(*args) = method_with_keywords(*args)

  method_with_positional(a: 1)
  # Ruby 3.1 and 3.2: behaves as expected:
  #   wrong number of arguments (given 1, expected 0) (ArgumentError)

  # This should work: method is marked with ruby2_keywords, so it
  # is able to repack hash as keyword_args
  ruby2_keywords def old_method(*args) = method_with_keywords(*args)

  old_method(a: 1)
  # Ruby 3.1 and 3.2: behaves as expected:
  #   prints {:a => 1}

  # This shouldn't work, but erroneously worked in 3.1: after `bad_old_method`
  # delegated the hash, it preserved "I am Ruby 2 keywords" through other
  # methods (even if they aren't marked to be compatible).
  ruby2_keywords def bad_old_method(*args) = method_with_positional(*args)

  bad_old_method(a: 1)
  # Ruby 3.1: prints {:a => 1}
  # Ruby 3.2: wrong number of arguments (given 1, expected 0) (ArgumentError)
  ```

### Removals[](#removals)

* Constants:
  * `Fixnum` and `Bignum` (deprecated since unification into `Integer` in [2.4](/2.4.html#fixnum-and-bignum-are-unified-into-integer))
  * `Random::DEFAULT` (deprecated in favor of per-Ractor random generator since [3.0](/3.0.html#randomdefault-behavior-change))
* Methods:
  * `Dir.exists?`,  `File.exists?` (deprecated since 2.1 as a general rule of having "bare verb" as a method name)
  * `Object#=~` (deprecated since [2.6](/2.6.html#minor-changes))
  * `Object#taint`, `#untaint`, `#tainted?`, `#trust`, `#untrust`, `#untrusted?` (deprecated together with a general concept of "safety" since [2.7](/2.7.html#safe-and-taint-concepts-are-deprecated-in-general))


## Core classes and modules[](#core-classes-and-modules)

### `Kernel#binding` raises if accessed not from Ruby[](#kernelbinding-raises-if-accessed-not-from-ruby)

`binding` is a method that returns "current context" (<a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Binding.html"><code>Binding</code></a>) object, allowing access to local variables, `self`, evaluating code in that context, etc. The problem solved was that it was accessible from C methods, too, but as C methods call don't push new "execution frames," the binding returned was of the last calling Ruby method, which was useless and misleading. Since Ruby 3.2, the method raises an exceptions in such situations.

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker bug" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18487">Bug #18487</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Kernel.html#method-i-binding"><code>Kernel#binding</code></a> (no mention for the behavior in non-Ruby frame)
* **Code:** To demonstrate the practical implications, the C code should be written, but to get the gist of what's happening, we can do this:
  ```ruby
  # The callable binding object, that will "bind" itself to argument, and call it in the context
  binding_caller = Kernel.instance_method(:binding).method(:bind_call)

  binding_caller.call(nil).local_variables
  # [:binding_caller] -- it is performed in the current context

  # method just accepts block and just calls it
  def test1(&)
    local_val = 'test'
    yield(nil)
  end

  test1(&binding_caller).local_variables
  #=> [:local_val] -- we got the binding of test1, as expected

  def test2(&)
    local_val = 'test'
    # Expectations: we pass block further, so it will be performed
    # inside #map, and the binding was to "insides" of each argument
    [1].map(&)
  end

  # Reality: #map is method defined in C, it doesn't has its own
  # "context frame",
  test2(&binding_caller).first.local_variables
  # So, in Ruby 3.1:
  #   => [:local_val] -- we still received binding of the previous method
  #                      in call chain
  # In Ruby 3.2:
  #   Cannot create Binding object for non-Ruby caller (RuntimeError)
  ```
* **Note:** `TracePoint#binding` was also adjusted for C methods, see [below](#tracepointbinding-returns-nil-for-c_callc_return).

### Class and Module[](#class-and-module)

#### `Class#attached_object`[](#classattached_object)

For singleton classes, returns the object this class is for; otherwise, raises `TypeError`.

* **Reason:** The "what is this singleton class around of" is useful in metaprogramming, introspection and code analysis, especially when some class methods are added via `class << self`.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12084">Feature #12084</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Class.html#method-i-attached_object"><code>Class#attached_object</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  String.attached_object
  # raises `String' is not a singleton class (TypeError)
  "foo".singleton_class.attached_object
  #=> "foo"

  # or
  class A
    class << self
      # here we are inside singleton class
      p attached_object
      #=> A
    end
  end

  # Usage for advanced metaprogramming:

  module MyCoolPlugin
    def self.prepended(mod)
      if mod.singleton_class? && mod.attached_object < Enumerable
        mod.include MyCoolPlugin::ServicesForEnumerable
      end
    end
  end

  class Simple
    class << self
      # prepends only simple version of MyCoolPlugin
      prepend MyCoolPlugin
    end
  end

  class MyArray < Array
    class << self
      # Prepend MyCoolPlugin, and includes MyCoolPlugin::ServicesForEnumerable
      prepend MyCoolPlugin
    end
  end

  # Usage for documentation/code analysis purposes:

  require 'active_support/all'
  Time.zone #=> nil, defined by ActiveSupport

  # Application-specific Time extensions
  class MyTime < Time
  end

  m = MyTime.method(:zone)
  # => #<Method: MyTime(Time).zone() /...path to implementation>

  # Now, if we want to path just this method to some
  # documentation or introspection system, it has enough information
  # to tell who it belongs to
  m.owner
  #=> #<Class:Time>
  m.receiver
  #=> MyTime

  # But before 3.2, there was no way to programmatically go from
  # singleton class #<Class:Time>, to the regular class Time, which
  # the method is defined in, from the human point of view.

  # Now, there is:
  m.owner.attached_object
  # => Time
  # ...an our documentation/introspection system can properly describe
  # it as a class method of Time.
  ```
* **Note:** The method will not work with "special" Ruby objects (`nil`, `true`, and `false`) which have their `singleton_class` implementations redefined to return regular class:
  ```ruby
  nil.singleton_class #=> NilClass, not #<Class:nil>
  class << nil
    attached_object # raises `NilClass' is not a singleton class (TypeError)
  end
  ```

#### `Module#const_added`[](#moduleconst_added)

A "hook" method, called after the constant was defined in a module.

* **Reason:** The method was proposed as helpful for autoloader libraries (like `zeitwerk`), but it also can be useful in metaprogramming, like "store a registry of nested classes of a particular type." Or "validate that some parent constant is redefined in a particular way."
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17881">Feature #17881</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Module.html#method-i-const_added"><code>Module#const_added</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  module Test
    def self.const_added(name)
      puts "const_added: #{name} = #{const_get(name)}"
    end

    # The method is called AFTER the constant is actually
    # defined, so its value is already available.
    FOO = 1
    # Prints:
    #   const_added: FOO = 1

    # Each constant override triggers a method again:
    FOO = 2
    # Prints:
    #  const_added: FOO = 2

    # Nested class definition:
    class Nested
      puts "Class definition body"
    end
    # Prints:
    #   const_added: Nested = Test::Nested
    #   Class definition body

    # Note that const_added invoked at the BEGINNING of class being defined,
    # not after its body is processed.
  end
  ```
* **Note:** To understand the last exampleâ€”why `const_added` was called before class definition is fully finishedâ€”you should consider that the class/module name becomes immediately known to Ruby after its definition is _opened_, allowing things like this:
  ```ruby
  module Test
    class Nested
      # outdated way of writing def self.class_method, but it works,
      # because Nested is already known name here.
      def Nested.class_method
      end

      # or this:
      weird_class_method
      # raises nice "undefined local variable or method `weird_class_method' for Test::Nested"
      # ...because the name `Test::Nested` is already associated with current class
    end
  end
  ```

#### `Module#undefined_instance_methods`[](#moduleundefined_instance_methods)

Lists methods that some module or class removed explicitly with `undef`.

* **Reason:** _Honestly, I have no idea. The discussion ticket doesn't clarify this either! I assume it is just for completeness, to make everything that Module **can** do with method definitions to be accessible programmatically. Or, might help with debuggin of some evil/buggy code that does undefining of wrong methods. --zverok_
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12655">Feature #12655</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Module.html#method-i-undefined_instance_methods"><code>Module#undefined_instance_methods</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  class ImmutableArray < Array
    undef :select!, :reject! #, ... etc
  end

  class UserArray < ImmutableArray
    undef :map
  end

  ImmutableArray.undefined_instance_methods #=> [:select!, :reject!]
  UserArray.undefined_instance_methods #=> [:map] -- only methods undefined by this module, not ancestors
  ```

### Refinements[](#refinements)

There are several new methods that improve the discovery and ability to debug for complicated code when it uses refinements. Those methods are improving answers to questions like "what methods are available in the current context and why?", "what methods will be available if I'll use that module" etc.

#### `Module#refinements`[](#modulerefinements)

Returns list of refinements the module defines.

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12737">Feature #12737</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Module.html#method-i-refinements"><code>Module#refinements</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  module MathShortcuts
    refine Numeric do
      def sqrt = Math.sqrt(self)
      # ...
    end

    refine String do
      def calculate(binding) = "#{self} = #{eval(self, binding)}"
    end
  end

  module NoRefinements
  end

  MathShortcuts.refinements #=> [#<refinement:Numeric@MathShortcuts>, #<refinement:String@MathShortcuts>]
  NoRefinemens.refinements #=> []

  # Introspection: what would this refinement refine?..
  # The method also added in 3.2, see below
  MathShortcuts.refinements[0].refined_class #=> Numeric
  # Introspection: what methods would it add?
  # (false means "don't include methods defined in ancestors")
  MathShortcuts.refinements[0].instance_methods(false) #=> [:sqrt]
  ```

#### `Refinement#refined_class`[](#refinementrefined_class)

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12737">Feature #12737</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Refinement.html#method-i-refined_class"><code>Refinement#refined_class</code></a>
* **Code:** See example above that demonstrates usage of `#refined_class` together with `Module#refinements`.
* **Note:** The name of the method implies only classes can be refined, which is not true; modules can be refined also, and `refined_class` will promptly return them:
  ```ruby
  module BetterEnum
    refine Enumerable do
      def each2(&block) = each_slice(2, &block)
    end
  end

  BetterEnum.refinements[0].refined_class #=> Enumerable

  using BetterEnum
  (1..6).each2.to_a #=> [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
  ```
  Currently [discussed](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19366).

#### `Module.used_refinements`[](#moduleused_refinements)

Returns instances of `Refinement` used in the current context.

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14332">Feature #14332</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Module.html#method-c-used_refinements"><code>Module.used_refinements</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  # See MathShortcuts module definition above

  class Calculator
    using MathShortcuts

    # Works inside refined module...
    p Module.used_refinements #=> [#<refinement:Numeric@MathShortcuts>, #<refinement:String@MathShortcuts>]

    def hypotenuse(c1, c2)
      # ...and inside its methods
      p Module.used_refinements #=> [#<refinement:Numeric@MathShortcuts>, #<refinement:String@MathShortcuts>]

      "(c1**2 + c2**2).sqrt".calculate(binding)
    end
  end

  # Use method with refinements, triggering all the debug print
  puts Calculator.new.hypotenuse(5, 6) #=> (c1**2 + c2**2).sqrt = 7.810249675906654

  # Outside of refined class, refinements are empty
  p Module.used_refinements #=> []
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * Note that `used_refinements` is a _class_ method of a `Module`, and put there just for organizational purposes, while returning refinements list of the _current context_. There is no way to ask arbitrary module which refinements it uses (e.g., there is no `Calculator.used_refiments`).
  * Just as a point of interest, the method with this name was proposed short after introducing of concept of refinements and was [discussed](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/7418) even before 2.0 release. It eventually became <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Module.html#method-c-used_modules"><code>Module.used_modules</code></a> introduced [in 2.4](2.4.html#moduleused_modules): that method just returned a list of modules with refinements, enabled in the current scope via `using`. The result of this method is not very fine-grained (as one refining method can refine _many_ objects at once, and it is impossible to inspect which exactly and what methods were added). After introduction of the `Refinement` class [in 3.1](3.1.html#refinement-class) it became reasonable to give easier access to particular refinements available in the current context.

### Integer#ceildiv[](#integerceildiv)

The integer division that always rounds up.

* **Reason:** There are many simple use cases like pagination (when "21 items / 10 per page" should yield "3 pages"). It seems that the method is a direct equivalent of `a.fdiv(b).ceil`, and as such, annoyingly unnecessary, but `fdiv`, due to floating point imprecision, might produce surprising results in edge cases:
  ```ruby
  99999999999999999.fdiv(1).ceil
  # => 100000000000000000
  99999999999999999.ceildiv(1)

### Strings and regexps[](#strings-and-regexps)

#### Byte-oriented methods[](#byte-oriented-methods)

Several method were added that operate on multibyte strings at byte-offset level, regardless of the encoding.

* **Reason:** Low-level processing of strings (like networks middleware, or efficient search algorithms, or packing/unpacking) might need an ability to operate on a level of single bytes, regardless of original string's encoding. It is especially important while handling variable-length encodings like UTF-8. Before methods introduction, the only way to perform byte-level processing was to forcing string encoding into `ASCII-8BIT`, process, and then force encoding back.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13110">Feature #13110</a> (`String#byteindex`, `String#byterindex`, `MatchData#byteoffset`), <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18598">Feature #18598</a> (`String#bytesplice`)
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/String.html#method-i-byteindex"><code>String#byteindex</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/String.html#method-i-byterindex"><code>String#byterindex</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/String.html#method-i-bytesplice"><code>String#bytesplice</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/MatchData.html#method-i-byteoffset"><code>MatchData#byteoffset</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  str = 'Ð¡Ð»Ð°Ð²Ð° Ð£ÐºÑ€Ð°Ñ—Ð½Ñ–'

  str.index('Ð°') #=> 2, character index
  str.byteindex('Ð°') #=> 4, byte index, because Cyrilic letters in UTF-8 take 2 bytes each

  str.rindex('Ð°') #=> 9: character index of the last entrance of character 'Ð°'
  str.byterindex('Ð°') #=> 17: byte index

  match = str.match(/Ð¡Ð»Ð°Ð²Ð°\s+(?<name>.+)/)
  match.offset(1)     #=> [6, 13]
  match.byteoffset(1) #=> [11, 25]
  match.offset(:name)     #=> [6, 13]
  match.byteoffset(:name) #=> [11, 25]

  str = 'Ð²Ñ–Ð¹Ð½Ð°'
  str.bytesplice(2..5, '...') #=> "..." -- returns replacement string
  str #=> "Ð²...Ð½Ð°" -- original string's bytes 2-3, 4-5 (e.g. chars 1 and 2) are replaced

  # Unlike byteslice getter, bytesplice setter checks character boundaries:
  str = 'Ð²Ñ–Ð¹Ð½Ð°'
  str.byteslice(1..3) #=> "\xB2Ñ–" -- works, even if the slice is mid-character
  str.bytesplice(1..3, '...') # offset 1 does not land on character boundary (IndexError)
  ```
* **Note:** After 3.2 release, `bytesplice` behavior [had changed](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19314#note-8) to return `self` instead of replacement string.

#### `String#dedup` as an alias for `-"string"`[](#stringdedup-as-an-alias-for--string)

The method produces frozen and deduplicated string without changing the receiver.

* **Reason:** Since [Ruby 2.5](2.5.html#string--optimized-for-memory-preserving), `-"string"` produces a frozen and **deduplicated** copy: all instances with the same content take the same place in memory. But it is a less-known fact, that is also hard to guess from the code and quick look into the docs. At the same time, it became a useful idiom for reducing a memory footprint of long-running applications. The `#dedup` alias is focused on the behavior, and also more chainable than unary `-`.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18595">Feature #18595</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/String.html#method-i-dedup"><code>String#dedup</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  protocols = %w[http https]
  domains = %w[company.com api.company.com]

  # if in various places of the program we constructing the same URLs many times...
  # ...there might be many similar strings sitting everywhere and taking memory
  urls = 100.times.map { protocols.sample + '://' + domains.sample }
  urls.uniq.count
  # => 4 -- we store 4 same strings again and again
  urls.map(&:object_id).uniq.count
  # => 100 -- but it is 100 different objects

  urls.map!(&:dedup)
  urls.map(&:object_id).uniq.count
  # => 4

  # The `map(&:dedup)` above could previously been written as
  urls.map!(&:-@)
  # ...which calls unary minus on arguments
  # But it is both uglier, and shows the intention worse.
  ```

#### `Regexp.new`: passing flags as a string is supported[](#regexpnew-passing-flags-as-a-string-is-supported)

* **Reason:** most of those working with regexps are used to short flag names like `/foo/i` or `/bar/m`. At the same time, when `Regexp.new` is constructed dynamically, there was necessary to use numeric flags `Regexp::IGNORECASE | Regexp::MULTILINE`. They are are more formal (and can be thought as more obvious), but string ones are those most of the Rubyists remember.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18788">Feature #18788</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Regexp.html#method-c-new"><code>Regexp.new</code></a> (`options` argument)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  Regexp.new('username', 'i') #=> /username/i
  # All known options work:
  Regexp.new(<<~'HTML', 'imx')
    <(\w+) .*?>
      [^<]+
    </\1>
  HTML
  #=> same as
  #  %r{<(\w+) .*?>
  #    [^<]+
  #  </\1>}imx

  # Unknown option raises
  Regexp.new('foo', 'g') # unknown regexp option: g (ArgumentError)
  ```
* **Notes:** One quirk that might be surprising with a wrong use of the new feature is that `Regexp.new` treats any truthy value of unrecognized type as "ignore case". So,
  ```ruby
  # This might erroneously thought to "work":
  Regexp.new('foo', %w[i]) #=> /foo/i, looks like array of options is also acceptable?..
  # ...but actually it is that any truthy value is treated as "ignorecase = true":
  Regexp.new('foo', %w[abc]) #=> /foo/i
  ```

#### `Regexp`: ReDoS vulnerability prevention[](#regexp-redos-vulnerability-prevention)

* **Reason:** The [ReDoS attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS) is overloading the system by providing malformed regexp or string to match. The possibility for this attack is mostly theoretical, but still reported as a security vulnerability in some contexts. New Ruby version introduces several features that might mitigate the attack (or, at least, a vulnerability report):
  * Setting explicit timeout for Regexp execution;
  * `Regexp.linear_time?` analysis method;
  * _(CRuby-specific) Cache-based optimization: many Regexps now perform in linear time even on very long strings (at the cost of increased memory consumption);_
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17837">Feature #17837</a> (timeout), <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19104">Feature #19104</a> (cache-based optimization), <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19194">Feature #19194</a> (`.linear_time?`)
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Regexp.html#method-c-timeout"><code>Regexp.timeout</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Regexp.html#method-c-timeout-3D"><code>Regexp.timeout=</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Regexp.html#method-c-new"><code>Regexp.new</code></a> (`timeout:` keyword argument), <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Regexp.html#method-c-linear_time-3F"><code>Regexp.linear_time?</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  Regexp.linear_time?(/a+$/)      #=> true
  Regexp.linear_time?(/(a+)\1*$/) #=> false, backtracking is complicated

  Regexp.timeout = 0.005
  # Just a demo: simple yet very ambigous regexp applied to very large string
  /(a+)\1*$/.match?('a' * 1_000_000)
  # Depending on your machine's performance, might raise:
  #   `match?': regexp match timeout (Regexp::TimeoutError)

  # When applied to a smaller string
  /(a+)\1*$/.match?('a' * 1_000)
  #=> true

  # This works, too:
  Regexp.new(/(a+)*$/, timeout: 0.005).match?('a' * 1_000_000)
  # Might raise:
  #   `match?': regexp match timeout (Regexp::TimeoutError)
  ```
* **Note:** While `Regexp.linear_time?` is part of the official language API, its results for the same regexps might change between versions and implementations.

### `Time.new` can parse a string[](#timenew-can-parse-a-string)

The new protocol for `Time.new` is introduced, that parses Time from string.

* **Reason:** Before Ruby 3.2, there core class `Time` provided no way to to get back a `Time` value from any serialization, including even simple `Time#inspect` or `#to_s`. The `Time.parse` provided by standard library `time` (not core functionality, doesn't work with explicit `require 'time'`), and tries to parse every imaginable format, while `Time.new` with string is stricter.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18033">Feature #18033</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Time.html#method-c-new"><code>Time.new</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  Time.new('2023-01-29 00:29:30')
  # => 2023-01-29 00:29:30 +0200

  # Desired timezone can be provided as part of a string:
  Time.new('2023-01-29 00:29:30 +08:00')
  #=> 2023-01-29 00:29:30 +0800
  # ...or like with other .new protocols, as a separate in: argument:
  Time.new('2023-01-29 00:29:30', in: '+08:00')
  #=> 2023-01-29 00:29:30 +0800

  # The accepted format is much stricter than Time.parse:
  require 'time'
  Time.parse('Jan 29, 2023')
  #=> 2023-01-29 00:00:00 +0200
  Time.new('Jan 29, 2023')
  # in `initialize': can't parse: "Jan 29, 2023" (ArgumentError)

  # Even incomplete time is considered an error (but see Notes below):
  Time.new('2023-01-29 00:29')
  # in `initialize': missing sec part: 00:29 (ArgumentError)
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * A few improvements are planned to be made to the parser strictness and robustness in 3.2.1 (see <a class="tracker bug" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19296">Bug #19296</a>, <a class="tracker bug" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19293">Bug #19293</a>), for example:
  ```ruby
  # This works, but is considered a bug, the method should allow
  # only fully-specified time
  Time.new("2023-01-29")
  #=> 2023-01-29 00:00:00 +0200
  ```
  * `Time.new('2023')` works, too, but it is a feature that worked before (force-conversion of singular year argument to integer), see <a class="tracker bug" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19293">Bug #19293</a>. It will probably be deprecated, but can't be quickly removed due to backward compatibility.

### `Struct` and `Data`[](#struct-and-data)

#### `Struct` can be initialized by keyword arguments by default[](#struct-can-be-initialized-by-keyword-arguments-by-default)

The default behavior of `Struct` since 3.2 is to accept both positional and keyword arguments in constructor.

* **Reason:** Since introduction of `Struct.new(<members>, keyword_init: true)` in 2.5, it was frequently criticized as clumsy
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16806">Feature #16806</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Struct.html#method-c-new"><code>Struct.new</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  User = Struct.new(:id, :name)
  # This works:
  User.new(1, 'Joan') #=> #<struct User id=1, name="Joan">
  # Since 3.2, this works too:
  User.new(id: 1, name: 'Joan') #=> #<struct User id=1, name="Joan">

  # keyword_arguments: true/false still can be provided to make the behavior stricter:

  User = Struct.new(:id, :name, keyword_init: true)
  User.new(id: 1, name: 'Joan') #=> #<struct User id=1, name="Joan">
  User.new(1, 'Joan')
  # in `initialize': wrong number of arguments (given 2, expected 0) (ArgumentError)

  User = Struct.new(:id, :name, keyword_init: false)
  User.new(1, 'Joan') #=> #<struct User id=1, name="Joan">
  User.new(id: 1, name: 'Joan')
  # => #<struct User id={:id=>1, :name=>"Joan"}, name=nil>
  # Note it is not ArgumentError, but interpreting all keyword args as one positional hash
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * The incompatibility might be introduced by code that expected singular hash as an argument for a Struct initialization:
    ```ruby
    Wrapper = Struct.new(:json_data)
    Wrapper.new(user: {name: 'Joan'})
    # Ruby 3.0: works
    #   #<struct Wrapper json_data={:user=>{:name=>"Joan"}}>
    # Ruby 3.1: warns, yet works
    #   warning: Passing only keyword arguments to Struct#initialize will behave differently from Ruby 3.2. Please use a Hash literal like .new({k: v}) instead of .new(k: v).
    #   #<struct Wrapper json_data={:user=>{:name=>"Joan"}}>
    # Ruby 3.2: breaks
    #   in `initialize': unknown keywords: user (ArgumentError)

    # Fixed by explicitly setting `keyword_init: false` in struct definition:
    Wrapper = Struct.new(:json_data, keyword_init: false)
    Wrapper.new(user: {name: 'Joan'})
    # => #<struct Wrapper json_data={:user=>{:name=>"Joan"}}>
    # ...on Ruby 2.5-3.2, without any warnings

    # or, alternatively, as always wrapping hashes in {} explicitly,
    # as 3.1's warning suggested:
    Wrapper.new({user: {name: 'Joan'}})
    # => #<struct Wrapper json_data={:user=>{:name=>"Joan"}}>
    ```
  * While the new behavior is convenient, one should be especially careful when redefining `#initialize` for `Struct`s to not break it:
    ```ruby
    User = Struct.new(:id, :new) do
      # suppose we want to convert id to Integer before initializing.
      # Note that it could be in `args.first`, or in `kwargs[:id]` now, so it is either this:
      def initialize(*args, **kwargs)
        if !args.empty?
          args[0] = args[0].to_i
        elsif kwargs.key?(:id)
          kwargs[:id] = kwargs[:id].to_i
        end
        super(*args, **kwargs)
      end

      # or just post-processing...
      def initialize(...)
        super(...)
        self.id = self.id.to_i
      end
    end
    ```

#### `Data`: new immutable value object class[](#data-new-immutable-value-object-class)

A new class for containing value objects: it is somewhat similar to `Struct` (and reuses some of the implementation internally), but is intended to be immutable, and have more modern and cleaner API.

* **Reason:** Before 3.2, `Struct` was an ubiquitous data holder class in Ruby, but being designed a long time ago, it has its drawbacks, making it not suitable for all situations: it is mutable by design (have argument setters), and have APIs of both "value-alike" and "container-alike" types. But there is a lot of code using `Struct` in various ways (and for good reasons), so it can't be just redesigned. Several approaches was considered (including adding a "configure" API to `Struct`, allowing to specify "should it be mutable, should it be iterable, should it be hash-alike"), but in the end, a new class with smaller and stricter API was designed.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16122">Feature #16122</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Data.html"><code>Data</code></a>
* **Code:** Data is completely new, well-documented class. So we wouldn't try to demonstrate all details of its behavior, just give a brief overview.
  ```ruby
  Point = Data.define(:x, :y)

  # Both positional and keyword arguments can be used
  p1 = Point.new(1, 0)        #=> #<data Point x=1, y=0>
  p2 = Point.new(x: 0, y: 1)  #=> #<data Point x=0, y=1>

  # all arguments are mandatory
  Point.new(1) # missing keyword: :y (ArgumentError)

  # #initialize might be redefined to provide default arguments or argument conversions
  Point3D = Data.define(:x, :y, :z) do
    def initialize(x:, y:, z: 0) = super
  end

  Point3D.new(x: 1, y: 2)
  # => #<data Point3D x=1, y=2, z=0>

  # the redefinition above is enough to handle keyword AND position arguments:
  Point3D.new(1, 2)
  # => #<data Point3D x=1, y=2, z=0>

  # there is no setters or any other way to change already created object
  p1.x = 5 # undefined method `x=' for #<data Point x=1, y=0> (NoMethodError)
  p1.instance_variable_set('@z', 100) # can't modify frozen Point: #<data Point x=1, y=0> (FrozenError)

  # #with method can be used to construct new instances,
  # replacing only parts of the data:
  p1.with(y: 100) #=> #<data Point x=1, y=100>
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * The class with the same name (`Data`) <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.5.0/Data.html">existed before</a> for internal purposesâ€”as a recommended empty base class for classes defined in C extensions. It was deprecated [since Ruby 2.5](2.5.html#misc), and removed in Ruby 3.0.
  * On `Data` immutability: note that only the `Data`-derived object itself is frozen, but there is no deep freezing of instance variables. So this is still possible (and up to user code to prevent, if undesirable):
    ```ruby
    Result = Data.define(:array)
    res = Result.new([1, 2, 3])
    res.instance_variable_set('@size', 3) #=> can't modify frozen Result, as expected
    # but...
    res.array << 4 # works
    res
    #=> #<data Result array=[1, 2, 3, 4]>

    # Can shoot yourself in the foot in code doing something like...
    case res
    in Result(array:) # unpack into local variable
      array.reverse!    # process it inplace, considering it independent local variable...
      # ...pass processed somewhere else...
    end

    # ...but actually data WAS changed:
    res
    #=> #<data Result array=[4, 3, 2, 1]>
    ```
  * `#with` method in Ruby 3.2 is naive and just copies all old and new attributes to the new instance, without invoking any custom initialization methods. In the next version, though, it [expected to call `#initialize`](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19259):
    ```ruby
    Point = Data.define(:x, :y) do
      def initialize(x:, y:) = super(x: x.to_i, y: y.to_i)
    end

    p = Point.new('1', '2')
    # => #<data Point x=1, y=2> -- conversion performed through #initialize
    p.with(y: '3')
    # => #<data Point x=1, y="3"> -- #initialize is bypassed

    # Probably since Ruby 3.2.1:
    p.with(y: '3')
    # => #<data Point x=1, y=3>
    ```

### Pattern matching[](#pattern-matching)

* "Find pattern" `value in [*, pattern, *]` is no longer experimental. <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18585">Feature #18585</a>

#### `MatchData`: added `#deconstruct` and `#deconstruct_keys`[](#matchdata-added-deconstruct-and-deconstruct_keys)

As a part of the effort to make core classes more pattern matching friendly, `MatchData` (the result of regexp matching) now can be deconstructed.

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18821">Feature #18821</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/MatchData.html#method-i-deconstruct"><code>MatchData#deconstruct</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/MatchData.html#method-i-deconstruct_keys"><code>MatchData#deconstruct_keys</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  case connection_string.match(%r{postgres://(\w+):(\w+)@(.+)})
  in 'admin', password, server
    # do connection with admin rights
  in ^DEV_USERS, _, 'dev-server.local'
    # connect to dev server with any password
  in user, password, server
    # do regular connection
  end

  # Might be used just for quick and expressive unpacking of match results
  connection_string = 'postgres://admin:secret@foo.amazonaws.com'
  connection_string.match(%r{postgres://(\w+):(\w+)@(.+)}) => user, password, server
  user     #=> "admin"
  password #=> "secret"
  server   #=> "foo.amazonaws.com"

  # When named capture group is used, MatchData also provides hash unpacking:
  connection_string.match(%r{postgres://(?<user>\w+):(?<password>\w+)@(?<server>.+)}) => user:, password:, server:
  user     #=> "admin"
  password #=> "secret"
  server   #=> "foo.amazonaws.com"
```

#### `Time#deconstruct_keys`[](#timedeconstruct_keys)

`Time` now can be used in pattern matching too.

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19071">Feature #19071</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Time.html#method-i-deconstruct_keys"><code>Time#deconstruct_keys</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  # `deconstruct_keys(nil)` shows all available keys:
  Time.now.deconstruct_keys(nil)
  # => {:year=>2023, :month=>1, :day=>15, :yday=>15, :wday=>0, :hour=>17, :min=>5, :sec=>56, :subsec=>(148452241/200000000), :dst=>false, :zone=>"EET"}

  # Usage in pattern-matching:
  case timestamp
  in year: ...2022
    puts "Far past!"
  in year: 2022, month: 1..3
    puts "Last year's first quarter"
  in year: 2023, month:, day:
    puts "#{day} of #{month}th month!"
  # ...
  end

  # Check if it is the first Thursday of the current month:
  if Time.now in wday: 4, day: ..7
    # ...
  ```

* **Notes:**
  * It was decided that `#deconstruct` method for `Time` doesn't make much sense, because the reasonable order for **all** of the time components is hard to define.
  * Standard library classes `Date` and `DateTime` also receive similar implementations (<a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Date.html#method-i-deconstruct_keys"><code>Date#deconstruct_keys</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/DateTime.html#method-i-deconstruct_keys"><code>DateTime#deconstruct_keys</code></a>):
    ```ruby
    require 'date'

    Date.today.deconstruct_keys(nil)
    #=> {:year=>2023, :month=>1, :day=>15, :yday=>15, :wday=>0}
    DateTime.now.deconstruct_keys(nil)
    # => {:year=>2023, :month=>1, :day=>15, :yday=>15, :wday=>0, :hour=>17, :min=>19, :sec=>15, :sec_fraction=>(478525469/500000000), :zone=>"+02:00"}
    ```

### Enumerables and collections[](#enumerables-and-collections)

#### `Enumerator.product`[](#enumeratorproduct)

Generates an enumerator from several other, yielding all possible combinations of their elements.

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18685">Feature #18685</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Enumerator.html#method-c-product"><code>Enumerator.product</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Enumerator/Product.html"><code>Enumerator::Product</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  enumerator = Enumerator.product(1.., %w[test me])
  # => #<Enumerator::Product: ...>

  enumerator.take(6)
  # => [[1, "test"], [1, "me"], [2, "test"], [2, "me"], [3, "test"], [3, "me"]]

  # The arguments can be any object responding to `each_entry`,
  # not necessary enumerator/enumerable
  class ThreeBears
    def each_entry
      yield 'Papa Bear'
      yield 'Mama Bear'
      yield 'Little Bear'
    end
  end
  Enumerator.product([1, 2], ThreeBears.new).to_a
  # => [[1, "Papa Bear"], [1, "Mama Bear"], [1, "Little Bear"],
  #     [2, "Papa Bear"], [2, "Mama Bear"], [2, "Little Bear"]]
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * It is [currently discussed](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19324) that protocol for `Enumerator.product` is unlike `Array#product` (which is a method of the first argument of the expression).
  * If one of the enumerators is effectful (can be iterated through only once), the current implementation would exhaust it on the first go:
    ```ruby
    require 'stringio'

    # This will work as expected
    io = StringIO.new('abc')
    Enumerator.product(io.each_char, [1, 2, 3]).to_a
    # => [["a", 1], ["a", 2], ["a", 3], ["b", 1], ["b", 2], ["b", 3], ["c", 1], ["c", 2], ["c", 3]]

    # But this will produce less data than the full cross-product
    # This will work as expected
    io = StringIO.new('abc')
    Enumerator.product([1, 2, 3], io.each_char).to_a
    #=> [[1, "a"], [1, "b"], [1, "c"]]
    ```
  This is probably a [bug](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19294).

#### `Hash#shift` always returns `nil` if the hash is empty[](#hashshift-always-returns-nil-if-the-hash-is-empty)

There was a bug/inconsistency with returning the default value if it is defined.

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker bug" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16908">Bug #16908</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Hash.html#method-i-shift"><code>Hash#shift</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  h = {a: 1}
  h.shift #=> [:a, 1]
  h.shift #=> nil, as expected
  # but if the default for hash is defined...
  h.default = :foo
  h.shift
  # 3.1: => :foo -- hard to explain, it isn't even [key, value] pair
  # 3.2: => nil
  ```

#### `Set` became a built-in class[](#set-became-a-built-in-class)

Previously a part of standard library, Set (a collection of unique elements) was promoted to core class. No more need to `require 'set'` to use the class.

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16989">Feature #16989</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Set.html"><code>Set</code></a> (still mentions `require 'set'`, though)
* **Notes:** As of 3.2, the only change is making the library auto-required without changing the implementation. `Set` is still not as integrated in Ruby as other collections, like `Hash` and `Array`: `Set` is implemented in Ruby, uses `Hash` as its internal storage (by creating a hash of `set_element => true` pairs), and doesn't have its own literal. There are distant plans to improve it, but with no particular schedule.

#### `Thread::Queue`: timeouts for `pop` and `push`[](#threadqueue-timeouts-for-pop-and-push)

`timeout: <number>` parameter was added to methods `Queue#pop`, `SizedQueue#push`, `SizedQueue#pop`.

* **Reason:** As thread queue is meant as a method of inter-thread communication, it is useful to provide a way for not hung a thread forever while waiting for input from other thread (or waiting for place in queue in case of `SizedQueue#push`)
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18774">Feature #18774</a>, <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18944">Feature #18944</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Thread/Queue.html#method-i-pop"><code>Thread::Queue#pop</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Thread/SizedQueue.html#method-i-pop"><code>Thread::SizedQueue#pop</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Thread/SizedQueue.html#method-i-push"><code>Thread::SizedQueue#push</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  queue = Thread::Queue.new
  sender = Thread.new do
    queue.push(1)
    queue.push(2)
  end

  # Expects 3 values from sender
  receiver = Thread.new do
    # This will print 1, 2, and then make receiver sleep forever:
    #   3.times.each { p queue.pop }

    # But this prints 1, 2, waits for 0.5 seconds and then prints `nil`
    3.times.map { p queue.pop(timeout: 0.5) }
  end
  [sender, receiver].each(&:join)

  sized = Thread::SizedQueue.new(2)
  sized.push(1, timeout: 0.5) #=> success, returns the queue object
  sized.push(2, timeout: 0.5) #=> success, returns the queue object
  sized.push(3, timeout: 0.5) #=> waits 0.5 seconds, returns nil
  sized.size #=> 2, only 1 and 2 were pushed successfully
  ```

### Procs and methods[](#procs-and-methods)

#### `Proc#dup` returns an instance of subclass[](#procdup-returns-an-instance-of-subclass)

* **Reason:** Just for consistency with other core classes behavior.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker bug" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17545">Bug #17545</a>
* **Documentation:** â€”
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  class MyProc < Proc
    # some additional custom methods...
  end

  MyProc.new { }.dup
  # 3.1: => #<Proc:...>
  # 3.2: => #<MyProc:...>
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * In general, inheriting from core classes is a questionable practice, and you probably should avoid it;
  * Despite producing an instance of a subclass now, `#dup` doesn't call `#initialize_dup` constructor, so no custom data that you've associated with a subclass instance can't be preserved:
    ```ruby
    class TaggedProc < Proc
      attr_reader :tag

      def initialize(tag, &block)
        @tag = tag
        super(&block)
      end

      def initialize_dup(other) # this will NOT be invoked
        @tag = other.tag
        super
      end
    end

    t = TaggedProc.new('test') { }
    t.tag #=> 'test'
    t.dup.tag #=> nil
    ```
  This is a [bug](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19362) and will probably <a class="github" href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/7178">change</a> in Ruby 3.2.1.

#### `Proc#parameters`: new keyword argument `lambda: true/false`[](#procparameters-new-keyword-argument-lambda-truefalse)

`parameters(lambda: true)` returns Proc parameters description _as if the proc was lambda_ (e.g. the parameters without defaults was mandatory), regardless of Proc's real "lambdiness."

* **Reason:** The regular (non-lamba) proc always reports its positional arguments is optional. It corresponds to its behavior, but loses the information which of them have default values defined. It might be inconvenient when using procs in metaprogramming, like building wrapper objects, or defining methods based on procs.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15357">Feature #15357</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Proc.html#method-i-parameters"><code>Proc#parameters</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  prc = proc { |x, y=0| p(x:, y:) }
  prc.parameters
  # => [[:opt, :x], [:opt, :y]] -- for proc, all parameters are optional
  # Whih corresponds to how it actually behaves: all params can be skipped:
  prc.call
  #=> {:x=>nil, :y=>0}

  prc.parameters(lambda: true)
  # => [[:req, :x], [:opt, :y]] -- in stricter lambda protocol, first parameter is required
  # Which corresponds to how the corresponding lambda would treat
  # its parameters:
  lambda { |x, y=0| p(x:, y:) }.call
  # wrong number of arguments (given 0, expected 1..2) (ArgumentError)

  # The `lambda: false` call works, too, although arguably less useful:
  l = ->(x, y=0) { }
  l.parameters
  # => [[:req, :x], [:opt, :y]]
  l.parameters(lambda: false)
  # => [[:opt, :x], [:opt, :y]]
  ```

#### `Method#public?`, `#protected?`, and `#private?` are removed[](#methodpublic-protected-and-private-are-removed)

Predicates to check method visibility added in Ruby 3.1 were reverted.

* **Reason:** The new feature implementation have led to several bugs with `Method` class behavior; while investigating the root cause for those bugs, Matz have decided that method's visibility is not its inherent property, but rather a property of the module/object that owns the method, and as such, is already present in form of `Module#{private,public,protected}_instance_methods` and `Object#{private,public,protected}_methods`
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/11689#note-24#note-24">Feature #11689<small>#note-24</small></a>
* **Notes:** The discussion whether the feature should be un-reverted is still ongoing!

#### `UnboundMethod`: more consistent reporting on what module it belongs to[](#unboundmethod-more-consistent-reporting-on-what-module-it-belongs-to)

Since 3.2, `UnboundMethod`'s `#inspect` and comparison with other `UnboundMethod` only considers the module it defined in, not the actual module it was unbound from.

* **Reason:** The change just aligns auxiliary methods with the main `UnboundMethod` implementation. No usage of unbound method is affected by what was the original class or object it was unbound from, only by the place of definition.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18798">Feature #18798</a>
* **Affected methods:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/UnboundMethod.html#method-i-3D-3D"><code>UnboundMethod#==</code></a>, `#inspect` (documentation not updated)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  tally = Array.instance_method(:tally)
  p tally
  # 3.1: => #<UnboundMethod: Array(Enumerable)#tally(*)>
  # 3.2: => #<UnboundMethod: Enumerable#tally(*)>
  # The former reports "it was defined in Enumerable, but unbound from Array"

  orig_tally = Enumerable.instance_method(:tally)
  tally == orig_tally
  # 3.1: false -- because it was unbound from different class
  # 3.2: true

  # In reality, both are the same, and can be rebound to any class including Enumerable:
  orig_tally.bind("test".each_char).call
  # => {"t"=>2, "e"=>1, "s"=>1}
  tally.bind("test".each_char).call
  # => {"t"=>2, "e"=>1, "s"=>1} -- on 3.1, this worked, even if tally was "unbound from Array"

  # Therefore, reporting `tally` as belonging to Array and unequal to `orig_tally` was misleading
  ```
* **Note:** While it might seem like a weird unnecessary quirk, unbinding methods and then rebinding them to different objects is useful metaprogramming technique when redefining some core methods to preserve and reuse the initial implementation.

### IO and network[](#io-and-network)

#### `IO`: support for timeouts for blocking IO[](#io-support-for-timeouts-for-blocking-io)

`IO#timeout` getter and setter were added to the base class, and are respected on blocking operations.

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18630">Feature #18630</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/IO.html#method-i-timeout"><code>IO#timeout</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/IO.html#method-i-timeout-3D"><code>IO#timeout=</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  STDIN.timeout = 5
  print "Tell me what: "
  answer = gets
  # If you didn't print anything for 5 seconds, this raises:
  # in `gets': Blocking operation timed out! (IO::TimeoutError)

  STDIN.timeout = nil # to remove the timeout
  answer = gets
  # will wait till input appears or process will be killed

  STDIN.timeout = 0
  answer = gets
  # Will raise IO::TimeoutError immediately,
  # useful for quick "take something from input buffer if it isn't empty"
  ```
* **Note:** `IO#timeout` in general affects reading and writing operations (including network ones, defined on <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Socket.html"><code>Socket</code></a>). Operations like `IO.open` and `IO#close` are **not** affected.

#### `IO#path`[](#iopath)

Any `IO` object can be constructed with additional argument `path:`, which will be available as a `path` attribute.

* **Reason:** `IO` object could be created from low-level file descriptor (for example, returned by some C extension), but there was no way to specify it corresponds to some specific filesystem path.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19036">Feature #19036</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/IO.html#class-IO-label-Open+Options">IO#Open options</a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/IO.html#method-i-path"><code>IO#path</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  # Always worked:
  f = File.open('README.md')
  f.path #=> 'README.md'

  # IO created from system-level file descriptor (which might've been returned by a C library)
  io = IO.new(f.fileno)
  # => #<IO:fd 5>
  io.path
  # 3.1: NoMethodError (undefined method `path')
  # 3.2: => nil

  # IO can't guess file path from the descriptor, but path can be provided explicitly:
  io = IO.new(f.fileno, path: 'README.md')
  # => #<IO:README.md>
  io.path
  # => "README.md"

  # One generalization of the new feature was to introspection of standard IO streams:
  STDOUT.path
  # 3.1: NoMethodError (undefined method `path')
  # 3.2: => "<STDOUT>"
  ```

### Exceptions[](#exceptions)

#### `Exception#detailed_message`[](#exceptiondetailed_message)

The method can be redefined for providing custom "decoration" of exception messages, without redefining the main `#message`.

* **Reason:** Standard libraries like `did_you_mean` (adds "did you mean _other name_" to `NoMethodError`) or `error_highlight` (printing of failed part of code and highlighting the problematic part) previously adjusted `Exception#message` method. It might not always be convenient: say, if an application wants to benefit from those gems, but also need to report "clear" error messages to a monitoring system, it required workaround. Starting from Ruby 3.2, there is a clear distinction:
  * `#message` is an original message with which the exception was raised;
  * `#decorated_message` might be redefined by some libraries or user's code for convenience and better reporting (most probably);
  * `#full_message` ([introduced](2.5.html#exceptionfull_message) in 2.5) is what the interpreter prints: detailed message + error backtrace.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18564">Feature #18564</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Exception.html#method-i-detailed_message"><code>Exception#detailed_message</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  # Default implementation:
  begin
    raise RuntimeError, 'test'
  rescue => e
    puts e.message
    # test

    puts e.detailed_message # adds error class
    # test (RuntimeError)

    puts e.full_message # adds backtrace
    # test.rb:3:in `<main>': test (RuntimeError)
  end

  # NoMethodError employs did_you_mean to lookup for the right name,
  # and error_highight to show where exactly the error happened:
  begin
    'foo'.lenthg
  rescue => e
    puts e.message
    # undefined method `lenthg' for "foo":String

    puts e.detailed_message # class name + highlighted part of code + "Did you mean?"
    # undefined method `lenthg' for "foo":String (NoMethodError)
    #
    #   'foo'.lenthg
    #        ^^^^^^^
    # Did you mean?  length

    puts e.full_message # all of the above + "where it happened"
    # test.rb:2:in `<main>': undefined method `lenthg' for "foo":String (NoMethodError)
    #
    #   'foo'.lenthg
    #        ^^^^^^^
    # Did you mean?  length
  end

  # Implement the custom one:
  class LoadError
    def detailed_message(highlight: false, **)
      res = super # invoke the default implementation which will produce message + class name
      return res unless path.start_with?('vendor/')

      # Provide custom value. Ideally, the code should consider to add some
      # markup with escape codes for expressiveness if `highlight: true` is passed
      res + "\n"\
            "  Vendor library `#{path.delete_prefix('vendor/')}' not loaded\n"\
            "  Check our instructions in VENDOR.md"
    end
  end

  require 'vendor/tricky'
  # This will now raise an error which would be printed as...
  #
  # in `require': cannot load such file -- vendor/tricky (LoadError)
  #   Vendor library `tricky' not loaded
  #   Check our instructions in VENDOR.md
  ```

#### `SyntaxError#path`[](#syntaxerrorpath)

Returns the path of where the error have happened.

* **Reason:** The feature was introduced by request of [SyntaxSuggest new core library](#standard-library-content-changes). It makes post-processing of SyntaxError easier for this and third-party libraries, say, when it is necessary to analyze the code that errored.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19138">Feature #19138</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/SyntaxError.html"><code>SyntaxError</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  # Consider there is 'test.rb' such that:
  x = 5
  y = 6
  z = x**
  #----

  begin
    load 'test.rb'
  rescue SyntaxError => e
    p e #=> #<SyntaxError:"tmp/test.rb:3: syntax error, unexpected end-of-input\n  z = x**\n         ^\n">
    puts e.path #=> test.rb
  end
  ```
* **Note:** As of 3.2, there is no way to set `path` (unlike other additional exception data like `KeyError#key` that can be set in `#initialize`). As `SyntaxError` is mostly meant to be generate by Ruby parser and not by custom code, that might not be a big problem.

### Concurrency[](#concurrency)

* For documentation purposes, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.1/Fiber/SchedulerInterface.html"><code>Fiber::SchedulerInteface</code></a> (3.0-3.1) was renamed to <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Fiber/Scheduler.html"><code>Fiber::Scheduler</code></a> (3.2+). It still serves just a documentation-level abstraction: no real class with such name exists, see [our explanations](https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/3.0.html#non-blocking-fiber-and-scheduler) in 3.0 changelog.

#### `Fiber` storage[](#fiber-storage)

Per-fiber hash-alike storage interface is introduced. It can be set up on Fiber creation, and accessed as a whole via `#storage` accessors, or key-by-key with `Fiber[]` accessors. By default, it is inherited on fiber creation, but can be overridden.

* **Reason:** The official explanation from NEWS is the best: "You should generally consider Fiber storage for any state which you want to be shared implicitly between all fibers and threads created in a given context, e.g. a connection pool, a request id, a logger level, environment variables, configuration, etc."
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19078">Feature #19078</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Fiber.html#method-c-5B-5D"><code>Fiber.[]</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Fiber.html#method-c-5B-5D-3D"><code>Fiber.[]=</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Fiber.html#method-i-storage"><code>Fiber#storage</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Fiber.html#method-i-storage-3D"><code>Fiber#storage=</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Fiber.html#method-c-new"><code>Fiber.new</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  Fiber[:user] = 'admin'
  Fiber[:user] #=> "admin"
  Fiber.current.storage #=> {user: 'admin'}
  # This will have no effect, storage returns a copy of internal storage
  Fiber.current.storage[:user] = 'John'
  # Still the same:
  Fiber[:user] #=> "admin"

  Fiber.current.storage = {user: 'Jane'}
  # warning: Fiber#storage= is experimental and may be removed in the future!
  Fiber[:user] #=> "Jane"

  # Cleaning up the storage
  Fiber.current.storage = nil
  Fiber.current.storage #=> {}

  Fiber[:user] = 'admin'
  f = Fiber.new { puts Fiber[:user] }
  f.resume # prints "admin", by default the storage is inherited
  f.storage
  # raises "Fiber storage can only be accessed from the Fiber it belongs to" (ArgumentError)

  # The storage can be overwritten on creation:
  Fiber.new(storage: {user: 'Jane'}) { puts Fiber[:user] }.resume
  # prints "Jane"
  # or...
  Fiber.new(storage: nil) { puts Fiber[:user] }.resume
  # prints empty string

  # The same as default: inherit from the creating fiber:
  Fiber.new(storage: true) { puts Fiber[:user] }.resume
  # prints "admin"

  # Even if inherited, fiber storage is isolated between fibers:
  f = Fiber.new {
    puts Fiber[:user]
    Fiber[:user] = 'Amy'
  }
  Fiber[:user] = 'Jane'
  f.resume
  # prints "admin" from fiber, change in the main fiber didn't affect inherited
  puts Fiber[:user]
  # prints "Jane", change in inherited fiber didn't affect the main one
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * Only `Fiber#storage=` is considered experimental; the rest of API is considered stable;
  * There is an [API discrepancy](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19377), currently discussed, between `Fiber[]` (which is class method, reading/writing current fiber's storage) and `Fiber.current.storage` (instance method, but available only on class instance);

#### `Fiber::Scheduler#io_select`[](#fiberschedulerio_select)

Implements non-blocking `IO.select`

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19060">Feature #19060</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Fiber/Scheduler.html#method-i-io_select"><code>Fiber::Scheduler#io_select</code></a>
* **Notes:**
  * See code examples in [3.0 changelog](3.0.html#non-blocking-fiber-and-scheduler) for general demo of using Fiber Scheduler. As no simple implementation is available, it is complicated to show an example of new hooks in play.
  * Just to remind: Ruby does not include the default implementation of Fiber Scheduler, but the maintainer of the feature, Samuel Williams, provides one in his gem <a class="github" href="https://github.com/socketry/async">Async</a> which is Ruby 3.2-compatible already.

### Internals[](#internals)

#### `Thread.each_caller_location`[](#threadeach_caller_location)

A way for enumerating backtrace entries without instantiating them all.

* **Reason:** There are may contexts when only a small chunk of the backtrace is necessary, but to find this chunk, the whole backtrace needs to be materalized with `#caller_locations`. For example, consider "send to monitoring system the first line in the `app/` that called this (library) query code." In large apps under high load, the call stack might be really large, and cost of its materialization into Ruby objects on frequent calls might be significant. The new method allows to go through stack frames one by one, and break as soon as the necessary one(s) is reached.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16663">Feature #16663</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Thread.html#method-c-each_caller_location"><code>Thread.each_caller_location</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  # test.rb
  def inner
    Thread.each_caller_location {
      p [_1, _1.class]
    }
  end

  def outer
    inner
  end

  outer
  # prints:
  #   ["test.rb:8:in `outer'", Thread::Backtrace::Location]
  #   ["test.rb:11:in `<main>'", Thread::Backtrace::Location]

  # More realistic usage:
  def method_to_debug
    # ...
    app_frame = nil
    Thread.each_caller_location {
      if _1.path.match?('/app')
        app_frame = _1
        break
      end
    }
    Monitoring.notify "Method was invoked by #{app_frame}"
    # ...
  end
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * Note that while each item is printed as a regular string, they are actually instances of an utility class <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Thread/Backtrace/Location.html"><code>Thread::Backtrace::Location</code></a>.
  * The method _consciously_ doesn't have block-less version (which should've returned `Enumerator` as Enumerable's method like `#each` or `#map` do): this would defy the point of efficient backtrace analysis _at the current frame_, adding more frames of Enumerable/Enumerator implementations;
  * For the reason of efficiency, `each_caller_location` returns nothing (again, to avoid materializing unnecessary objects), so if the goal is to find one location, as in example above, or select some part of the call stack, the only way to do it is non-idiomatic code:
    ```ruby
    lib = []

    # Goal: take the first caller locations while they are inside our app's lib/ folder:
    Thread.each_caller_locaton {
      lib << _1
      break unless _1.start_with?('lib/')
    }
    ```

#### `GC.latest_gc_info`: add `need_major_gc:` key[](#gclatest_gc_info-add-need_major_gc-key)

* **Reason:** The information (whether the next garbage collection would be _minor_ or _major_) might be useful for highload systems, where it might make sense to trigger garbage-collection preemptively if the next one would be major, before entering the performance-critical part of the code.
* **Discussion:** <a class="github" href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/6791">GH-6791</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/GC.html#method-c-latest_gc_info"><code>GC.latest_gc_info</code></a> (the possible keys aren't documented)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  GC.latest_gc_info
  # 3.1:
  #   => {:major_by=>nil, :gc_by=>:newobj, :have_finalizer=>false, :immediate_sweep=>false, :state=>:sweeping}
  # 3.2:
  #   => {:major_by=>nil, :need_major_by=>nil, :gc_by=>:newobj, :have_finalizer=>false, :immediate_sweep=>false, :state=>:none}

  # Or:
  GC.latest_gc_info(:need_major_by) #=> nil
  ```
* **Notes:** The author of this changelog is not a GC expert, and the matter is not very well documented, so I only can say that the possible values (besides `nil`), according to feature's code, are `:nofree`, `:oldgen`, `:shady`, `:force`, and they are the same as `major_by:` possibe values. As far as I can guess, `major_by:` describes the latest major GC method, while `need_major_by:` describes the upcoming one; if it is `nil`, the major GC is not upcoming probably?..

#### `ObjectSpace`: dumping object shapes[](#objectspace-dumping-object-shapes)

Object Shapes is a large and interesting new internal object structuring approach which we (being focused on language API) wouldn't explain here. The explanation and discussion can be found at <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18776">Feature #18776</a>. The only way the Ruby-level API is affected by the change is a new parameter for `ObjectSpace.dump_all` method, that allows to dump _shapes_ defined so far.

* **Discussion:** <a class="github" href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/6868">GH-6868</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/ObjectSpace.html#method-i-dump_all"><code>ObjectSpace#dump_all</code></a> (docs not fully updated, though)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  require 'objspace'

  # To only output what would be put int ObjectSpace since this point
  gc_generation = GC.count
  since_id = RubyVM.stat(:next_shape_id)

  # New shapes are defined when instance vars for objects are set, so let's make one!
  class User
    def initialize(id, name)
      @id = id
      @name = name
    end
  end

  User.new(1, 'Yuki')

  ObjectSpace.dump_all(output: :stdout, since: gc_generation, shapes: since_id)
  # {"address":"0x7f6490e00da0", "type":"SHAPE", "id":237, "parent_id":5, "depth":3, "shape_type":"IVAR","edge_name":"@id", "edges":1, "memsize":120}
  # {"address":"0x7f6490e00dc0", "type":"SHAPE", "id":238, "parent_id":237, "depth":4, "shape_type":"IVAR","edge_name":"@name", "edges":0, "memsize":32}
  ```
  This reads: setting `@id` creates a new shape (with `"id":237`), and setting `@name` creates the next one, inherited from from that (`"id":238, "parent_id":237`). To understand the deep meaning and consequences of this behavior, though, we'll refer to the [original discussion](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18776).

#### `TracePoint#binding` returns `nil` for `c_call`/`c_return`[](#tracepointbinding-returns-nil-for-c_callc_return)

* **Reason:** See `Kernel#binding` [explanations above](#kernelbinding-raises-if-accessed-not-from-ruby): C methods don't have their own binding, so before Ruby 3.2, `TracePoint#binding` for their call confusingly returned the binding of the first Ruby caller in the call stack.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker bug" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18487">Bug #18487</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/TracePoint.html#method-i-binding"><code>TracePoint#binding</code></a> (still has docs for old behavior, though)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  TracePoint.new(:c_call) do |tp|
    p [tp.method_id, tp.binding, tp.binding&.local_variables]
  end.enable {
    x = [5]
    x.map { }
  }
  # In Ruby 3.1, this prints:
  #   [:map, #<Binding:0x00007fbfb9b36d40>, [:x]] -- so, we have a binding of surrounding block, not insides of `map`
  # In Ruby 3.2:
  #   [:map, nil, nil]
  ```

#### `TracePoint` for block default to trace the current thread[](#tracepoint-for-block-default-to-trace-the-current-thread)

* **Reason:** In block form, the intention of the developer is to trace what's happening in the specified block. In complicated applications, though, other threads might work at the same time and pollute the tracing with unrelated occurrences.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker bug" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16889">Bug #16889</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/TracePoint.html#method-i-enable"><code>TracePoint#enable</code></a>.
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  def test = nil

  other = Thread.start {
    sleep(0.1) # to give TracePoint time to start
    test
  }

  Thread.current.name = 'main'
  other.name = 'other'

  # Note: each example below needs to restart the "other" thread.

  TracePoint.new(:call) do |tp|
    puts "Called from #{Thread.current}" if tp.method_id == :test
  end.enable do
    test
    other.join
  end
  # Ruby 3.1:
  #   Called from #<Thread:...@main run>
  #   Called from #<Thread:...@other run>
  # Ruby 3.2:
  #   Called from #<Thread:...@main run>

  # The desired thread to trace can be specified explicitly:
  TracePoint.new(:c_call) do |tp|
    puts "Called from #{Thread.current}" if tp.method_id == :size
  end.enable(target_thread: other) do
    test
    other.join
  end
  # Ruby 3.1 and 3.2:
  #   Called from #<Thread:...@other run>

  # Only block form is affected:
  tp = TracePoint.new(:c_call) do |tp|
    puts "Called from #{Thread.current}" if tp.method_id == :size
  end
  tp.enable

  test
  other.join
  # Ruby 3.1 & 3.2:
  #   Called from #<Thread:...@main run>
  #   Called from #<Thread:...@other run>

  # If target for tracing is explicitly specified, all threads are traced:
  TracePoint.new(:c_call) do |tp|
    puts "Called from #{Thread.current}" if tp.method_id == :size
  end.enable(target: method(:test)) do
    test
    other.join
  end
  # Ruby 3.1 & 3.2:
  #   Called from #<Thread:...@main run>
  #   Called from #<Thread:...@other run>
  ```

### `RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree`[](#rubyvmabstractsyntaxtree)

#### `error_tolerant: true` option for parsing[](#error_tolerant-true-option-for-parsing)

With this option, parsing can be performed even on incomplete and syntactically incorrect scripts, replacing unparseable parts with `ERROR` token.

* **Reason:** The new option opens road for using Ruby native parser for various language tools working on the fly, while the code is written (like [LSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol)) or providing advice and possible fixes on erroneous code. It is important that "official" language parser supported such cases out-of-the-box.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19013">Feature #19013</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/RubyVM/AbstractSyntaxTree.html#method-c-parse"><code>AbstractSyntaxTree.parse</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  src = <<~RUBY
    def test
  RUBY

  RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree.parse(src)
  # in `parse': syntax error, unexpected end-of-input (SyntaxError)

  root = RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree.parse(src, error_tolerant: true)
  pp root
  # Shortening for the sake of this changelog, the structure of the tree would be:
  #
  #   (SCOPE@1:0-1:8
  #    body:
  #      (DEFN@1:0-1:8
  #       mid: :test
  #       body:
  #         (SCOPE@1:0-1:8
  #          args:
  #            (ARGS@1:8-1:8 ...)
  #          body: nil)))
  #
  # E.g. the code is correctly parsed as "a beginning of a method `test`
  # without a body"

  # The parser also tries to recover from errors in the middle of the script:
  src = <<~RUBY
    def bad
      x +
    end

    def good
      puts 'ok'
    end
  RUBY

  root = RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree.parse(src, error_tolerant: true)
  pp root
  # Shortened output again...

  #
  # Note the ERROR node in the midle of method :bad, but then properly parsed
  # body of method :good
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * Recovery not guaranteed

#### `keep_tokens: true` option for parsing[](#keep_tokens-true-option-for-parsing)

With `keep_tokens: true` option provided, `AbstractSyntaxTree.parse` will attach corresponding code tokens array to each node of the syntax tree.

* **Reason:** As the previous feature, this one is useful for implementing code analysis tools: there are several ways to write code that will produce exactly the same syntax tree; and while it doesn't affect interpreting, it does affect style checking, suggestions etc.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19070">Feature #19070</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/RubyVM/AbstractSyntaxTree.html#method-c-parse"><code>AbstractSyntaxTree.parse</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/RubyVM/AbstractSyntaxTree/Node.html#method-i-tokens"><code>Node#tokens</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/RubyVM/AbstractSyntaxTree/Node.html#method-i-all_tokens"><code>Node#all_tokens</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree.parse("puts 'test'", keep_tokens: true).tokens
  # =>
  # [[0, :tIDENTIFIER, "puts", [1, 0, 1, 4]],
  #  [1, :tSP, " ", [1, 4, 1, 5]],
  #  [2, :tSTRING_BEG, "'", [1, 5, 1, 6]],
  #  [3, :tSTRING_CONTENT, "test", [1, 6, 1, 10]],
  #  [4, :tSTRING_END, "'", [1, 10, 1, 11]]]
  RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree.parse("puts('test')", keep_tokens: true).tokens
  # =>
  # [[0, :tIDENTIFIER, "puts", [1, 0, 1, 4]],
  #  [1, :"(", "(", [1, 4, 1, 5]],
  #  [2, :tSTRING_BEG, "'", [1, 5, 1, 6]],
  #  [3, :tSTRING_CONTENT, "test", [1, 6, 1, 10]],
  #  [4, :tSTRING_END, "'", [1, 10, 1, 11]],
  #  [5, :")", ")", [1, 11, 1, 12]]]
  RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree.parse("puts('test', )", keep_tokens: true).tokens
  # =>
  # [[0, :tIDENTIFIER, "puts", [1, 0, 1, 4]],
  #  [1, :"(", "(", [1, 4, 1, 5]],
  #  [2, :tSTRING_BEG, "'", [1, 5, 1, 6]],
  #  [3, :tSTRING_CONTENT, "test", [1, 6, 1, 10]],
  #  [4, :tSTRING_END, "'", [1, 10, 1, 11]],
  #  [5, :",", ",", [1, 11, 1, 12]],
  #  [6, :tSP, " ", [1, 12, 1, 13]],
  #  [7, :")", ")", [1, 13, 1, 14]]]
  ```
  Note that all three scripts are exactly equivalent execution-wise and will produce the same syntax tree; but from the point of view of code analysis tool, they are different. For example, the first one might cause the suggestion to add parentheses (if that's the preferred style setting), and the last one might imply that the user waits for suggestions for possible local variables to add to output.

## Standard library[](#standard-library)

By Ruby 3.1 release, most of the standard library is extracted to either _default_ or _bundled_ gems; their development happens in separate repositories, and changelogs are either maintained there, or absent altogether. Either way, their changes aren't mentioned in the combined Ruby changelog, and I'll not be trying to follow all of them.

> **[stdgems.org](https://stdgems.org/)** project has a nice explanations of default and bundled gems concepts, as well as a list of currently gemified libraries and links to their docs.

> "For the rest of us" this means libraries development extracted into separate GitHub repositories, and they are just packaged with main Ruby before release. It means you can do issue/PR to any of them independently, without going through more tough development process of the core Ruby.

A few changes to mention, though:

* <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Pathname.html#method-i-lutime"><code>Pathname#lutime</code></a>.
* <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/FileUtils.html#method-c-ln_sr"><code>FileUtils.ln_sr</code></a> and `relative:` option for <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/FileUtils.html#method-c-ln_s"><code>FileUtils.ln_s</code></a>. Discussion: <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18925">Feature #18925</a>.
* <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/CGI/Escape.html#method-i-escapeURIComponent"><code>CGI.escapeURIComponent</code></a> and <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/CGI/Escape.html#method-i-unescapeURIComponent"><code>CGI.unescapeURIComponent</code></a> are added. This is an attempt to mitigate discrepancy between various helper method throughout the standard libraries like `URI`, `ERB` and `CGI`. Discussion: <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18822">Feature #18822</a>
  * The difference with `CGI.escape`/`unescape` is only in encoding and decoding `' '` character (`escape` follows `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` which converts it to `+`, while `escapeURIComponent` follows RFC 3986 and converts it to `'%20'`)
  * Previously, the goal could've been achieved with `URI.escape`, but it was deprecated since 1.9 and removed in 3.0, being too vague and generic (it actually meant to replace all "unsafe" characters on URI construction).
  * Unusual for Ruby method names are mimicking well-known JS ones like [encodeURIComponent](https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent).
* `Coverage`:
  * The internal changes in interpreter were made so the standard library would be able to measure code coverage of `eval`-ed code.
    * Discussion: <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19008">Feature #19008</a>.
    * Docs <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Coverage.html#method-c-setup"><code>Coverage.setup</code></a> (enabled with `eval: true`, or `:all` arguments)
  * <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Coverage.html#method-c-supported-3F"><code>.supported?</code></a>. Discussion: <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19026">Feature #19026</a>
* There are many awesome changes in Ruby's console IRB, see the gem author's article [What's new in Ruby 3.2's IRB?](https://st0012.dev/whats-new-in-ruby-3-2-irb).

### Standard library content changes[](#standard-library-content-changes)

* <a class="github" href="https://github.com/ruby/syntax_suggest">syntax_suggest</a> (formerly `dead_end`) gem added. It provides helpful error messages for wrong syntax, trying to guess the place of the error. For example, assuming this `test.rb`:
  ```ruby
  def foo
    [1, 2, 3].each {
  end
  ```
  an attempt to run it with Ruby 3.1 produces:
  ```
  test.rb:3: syntax error, unexpected `end'
  ```
  while Ruby 3.2 produces:
  ```
  Unmatched `{', missing `}' ?
    23  def foo
  > 24    [1, 2, 3].each {
    25  end
  test.rb:3: syntax error, unexpected `end' (SyntaxError)
  ```
