## Highlights[](#highlights)

TODO

## Language changes[](#language-changes)

### Standalone `it` in blocks will become anonymous argument in Ruby 3.4[](#standalone-it-in-blocks-will-become-anonymous-argument-in-ruby-34)

In Ruby 3.3, it will just warn to prepare for a change.

* **Reason:** Numeric designation for anonymous bloc arguments (`_1`, `_2`, and so on) were considered ugly by many people, so after years of discussion, the `it` keyword is to be introduced on the next Ruby version; for now, it just warns _in places where it would be considered an anonymous block argument_.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #18980]
* **Code:** In the code below, where Ruby 3.3 currently produces a warning, Ruby 3.4 would treat `it` as an anonymous block argument; where Ruby 3.3 doesn't produce a warning, Ruby 3.4 would treat `it` as a local variable name or a method call (and would look for such names available in the scope).
  ```ruby
  # The cases that are warned:
  # -------------------------
  # warning: `it` calls without arguments will refer to the first block param in Ruby 3.4; use it() or self.it

  (1..3).map { it }      # inside a block without explicit parameters
  (1..3).map { it; _1 }  # ...even if numbered parameters are used, too
  def it; end
  (1..3).map { it }      # even if a method with name `it` exists in the scope

  # The cases that are not warned:
  # -----------------------------

  it                        # not inside a block
  (1..3).map { |x| it }     # inside a block with named parameters
  (1..3).map { || it }      # ...even if they are empty
  (1..3).map { it() }       # with parentheses
  (1..3).map { it {} }      # with a block attached
  (1..3).map { it = 5; it } # if a local variable with the same name is created in the block
  it = 5
  (1..3).map { it }         # if a local variable with the same name is in the scope
  ```
* **Notes:** The new feature isn't expected to conflict with RSpec's [`it`](https://rspec.info/documentation/3.12/rspec-core/RSpec/Core/ExampleGroup.html#it-class_method), as calling that without any block attached, or at least a description for the future example, is useless.

## Core classes and modules[](#core-classes-and-modules)

### `Kernel#lambda` raises when passed `Proc` instance[](#kernellambda-raises-when-passed-proc-instance)

* **Reason:** `lambda`'s goal is to create a lambda from provided literal block; in Ruby, it is impossible to change the "lambdiness" of the block once it is created. But `lambda(&proc_instance)` never notified users of that, which was confusing.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #19777]
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Kernel.html#method-i-lambda"><code>Kernel#lambda</code></a> _(no specific details are provided, though)_
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  # Intended usage:
  l = lambda { |a, b| a + b }
  l.lambda? #=> true
  l.parameters #=> [[:req, :a], [:req, :b]]

  # Unintended usage:
  p = proc { |a, b| a + b }

  # In Ruby 3.2 and below, it worked, but the produced value wasn't lambda:
  l = lambda(&p)
  l.parameters #=> [[:opt, :a], [:opt, :b]]
  l.lambda? #=> false
  l.object_id == p.object_id #=> true, it is just the same proc

  # Ruby 3.3:
  l = lambda(&p)
  # in `lambda': the lambda method requires a literal block (ArgumentError)

  # Despite the message about a "literal block," the method
  # works (though has no meaningful effect) with lambda-like Proc objects
  other_lambda = lambda { |a, b| a + b }
  lambda(&other_lambda) #=> works
  lambda(&:to_s) #=> works
  lambda(&method(:puts)) #=> works
  ```
* **Notes:** The discussion was once [started](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15973) from the proposal to make `lambda` change "lambiness" of a passed block, but it raises multiple issues (changing the block semantics mid-program is just one of them). In general, `lambda` as a _method_ is considered legacy, inferior to the `-> { }` lambda literal syntax, exactly due to problems like this: it looks like a regular method that receives a block, and therefore should be able to accept _any_ block, but in fact it is "special" method. So in 3.0, there was a warning about `lambda(&proc_instance)`, and since 3.3, the warning finally turned into an error.

### `Proc#dup` and `#clone` call `#initialize_dup` and `#initialize_copy`[](#procdup-and-clone-call-initialize_dup-and-initialize_copy)

* **Reason:** A fix for a small inconsistency created [in 3.2](3.2.html#procdup-returns-an-instance-of-subclass): Since that version, `#dup` and `#clone` on an object inherited from the `Proc`, rightfully produced an instance of the inherited class. But despite `Object`'s `#dup` and `#clone` methods docs claiming that corresponding copying constructors would be called on object cloning/duplication, it was not true for `Proc`.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #19362]
* **Documentation:** — (Adheres to the behavior described for <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Object.html#method-i-dup"><code>Object#dup</code></a> and <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Kernel.html#method-i-clone"><code>#clone</code></a>)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  # The examples would work the same way with
  # #dup/#initialize_dup and #clone/#initialize_copy

  class TaggedProc < Proc
    attr_reader :tag

    def initialize(tag)
      super()
      @tag = tag
    end

    def initialize_dup(other)
      @tag = other.tag
      super
    end
  end

  proc = TaggedProc.new('admin') { }

  proc.tag #=> 'admin'
  proc.dup.tag
  # Ruby 3.1:
  #   undefined method `tag' for #<Proc:0x0...> -- #dup didn't preserve the class
  # Ruby 3.2:
  #   => nil -- the class is preserved, yet the duplication didn't went through #initialize_dup
  # Ruby 3.3:
  #   => "admin"
  ```
* **Notes:** Inheriting from core classes is an advanced technique, and most of the times there are simple ways to achieve same goals (like wrapper objects containing a `Proc` and an additional info).

### `Module#set_temporary_name`[](#moduleset_temporary_name)

Allows to assign a string to be rendered as class/module's `#name`, without assigning the class/module to a constant.

* **Reason:** The feature is useful to provide reasonable representation for dynamically auto-generated classes without assigning them to constants (which pollutes the global namespace and might conflict with existing constants) or redefining `Class#name` (which might break other code and not always respected in the output).
* **Discussion:** [Feature #19521]
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Module.html#method-i-set_temporary_name"><code>Module#set_temporary_name</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  dynamic_class = Class.new do
    def foo; end
  end

  dynamic_class.name #=> nil

  # For dynamic classes, representation of related values is frequently unreadable:
  dynamic_class #=> #<Class:0x0...>
  instance = dynamic_class.new #=> #<#<Class:0x0...>:0x0...>
  instance.method(:foo) #=> #<Method: #<Class:0x0...>#foo() ...>

  dynamic_class::Nested = Module.new
  dynamic_class::Nested #=> #<Class:0x0...>::Nested

  # After assigning the temporary name, representation becomes more convenient:
  dynamic_class.set_temporary_name("MyDSLClass(with description)")

  dynamic_class #=> MyDSLClass(with description)
  instance #=> #<MyDSLClass(with description):0x0...>
  instance.method(:foo) #=> #<Method: MyDSLClass(with description)#foo() ...>

  # Note that module constant names are assigned at the moment of their creation,
  # and don't change when the temporary name is assigned:
  dynamic_class::OtherNested = Module.new

  dynamic_class::Nested #=> #<Class:0x0...>::Nested
  dynamic_class::OtherNested #=> MyDSLClass(with description)::OtherNested

  # Assigning names that correspond to constant name rules is prohibited:
  dynamic_class.set_temporary_name("MyClass")
  # `set_temporary_name': the temporary name must not be a constant path to avoid confusion (ArgumentError)
  dynamic_class.set_temporary_name("MyClass::NestedName")
  # `set_temporary_name': the temporary name must not be a constant path to avoid confusion (ArgumentError)

  # When the module with a temporary name is put into a constant,
  # it receives a permanent name, which can't be changed anymore
  C = dynamic_class

  # It affects all associated values (including modules)

  dynamic_class #=> C
  instance #=> #<C:0x0...>
  instance.method(:foo) #=> #<Method: C#foo() ...>
  dynamic_class::Nested #=> C::Nested
  dynamic_class::OtherNested #=> C::OtherNested

  dynamic_class.set_temporary_name("Can I have it back?")
  # `set_temporary_name': can't change permanent name (RuntimeError)

  # `nil` can be used to cleanup a temporary name:
  other_class = Class.new
  other_class.set_temporary_name("another one")
  other_class #=> another one
  other_class.set_temporary_name(nil)
  other_class #=> #<Class:0x0...>
  ```
* **Notes:** Any phrase that used as a temporary name would be used verbatim; this might create very confusing `#inspect` results and error messages; so it is advised to use strings somehow implying that the name belong to a module. Imagine we wrap into classes with temporary names RSpec-style examples, and then there is a typo in the body of such example:
  ```ruby
  it "works as a calculator" do
    expec(2+2).to eq 4
  end
  # If we assign just the example description as a temp.name, the
  # error would look like this:
  #
  #   undefined method `expec' for an instance of works as a calculator
  #                                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  #
  # ...which is confusing. So it is probably better to construct a
  # module-like temporary name, to have:
  #
  #   undefined method `expec' for an instance of MyFramework::Example("works as a calculator")
  #                                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  ```

### `Refinement#refined_class` is renamed to `Refinement#target`[](#refinementrefined_class-is-renamed-to-refinementtarget)

Just a renaming of the unfortunately named new method that [emerged in Ruby 3.2](/rubychanges/3.2.html#refinementrefined_class).

* **Discussion:** [Feature #19714]
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Refinement.html#method-i-target"><code>Refinement#target</code></a>

### Strings and regexps[](#strings-and-regexps)

#### `String#bytesplice`: new arguments to select a portion of the replacement string[](#stringbytesplice-new-arguments-to-select-a-portion-of-the-replacement-string)

The low-level string manipulation method now allows to provide a coordinates of the part of the replacement string to be used.

* **Reason:** The new "byte-oriented" methods [were introduced](https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/3.2.html#byte-oriented-methods) in Ruby 3.2 to support low-level programming like text editors or network protocol implementations. In those use cases, the necessity of copying of a small part of one string into the middle of another is frequent, and producing intermediate strings (by first slicing the necessary part) is costly.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #19314]
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/String.html#method-i-bytesplice"><code>String#bytesplice</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  # Base usage
  'foo'.byteplice(1..2, 'bar', 0..1)
  # The receiver is modified

  # Or, alternatively:
  'foo'.byteplice(1, 2, 'bar', 0, 1)

  # Two forms can't be mixed:
  'foo'.byteplice(1..2, 'bar', 0, 1)
  # Semi-open ranges work:
  'foo'.byteplice(1..2, 'bar', 1..)
  'foo'.byteplice(1..2, 'bar', ..1)

  ```

#### `MatchData#named_captures`: `symbolize_names:` argument[](#matchdatanamed_captures-symbolize_names-argument)

* **Discussion:** [Feature #19591]
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/MatchData.html#method-i-named_captures"><code>MatchData#named_captures</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  m = "2023-12-25".match(/(?<year>\d{4})-(?<month>\d{2})-(?<day>\d{2})/)
  m.named_captures
  #=> {"year"=>"2023", "month"=>"12", "day"=>"25"}
  m.named_captures(symbolize_names: true)
  #=> {:year=>"2023", :month=>"12", :day=>"25"}
  ```
* **Notes:** While `symbolize_names:` might looks somewhat strange (usually we talk about hash _keys_), it is done for consistency with Ruby standard library's <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/JSON.html#module-JSON-label-Output+Options"><code>`JSON.parse`</code></a> signature, which inherited the terminology from the JSON specification.

### `Array#pack` and `String#unpack`: raise `ArgumentError` for unknown directives[](#arraypack-and-stringunpack-raise-argumenterror-for-unknown-directives)

* **Discussion:** [Bug #19150]
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/packed_data_rdoc.html"><code>doc/packed_data.rdoc</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  [1, 2, 3].pack('r*')
  # Ruby 3.1:
  #   => "", no warning
  # Ruby 3.2:
  #   => "", warning: unknown pack directive 'r' in 'r*'
  # Ruby 3.3:
  #   in `pack': unknown pack directive 'r' in 'r*' (ArgumentError)
  ```
* **Notes:**

### Enumerables and collections[](#enumerables-and-collections)

#### `ObjectSpace::WeakKeyMap`[](#objectspaceweakkeymap)

A new "weak map" concept implementation. Unlike `ObjectSpace::WeakMap`, it compares keys by equality (`WeakMap` compares by identity), and only references to keys are weak (garbage-collectible).

* **Reason:** The idea of a new class grew out of increased usage of `ObjectSpace::WeakMap` (which was once considered internal). In many other languages, concept of "weak map" implies only key references are weak: this allows to use it as a generic "holder of some additional information related to a set of objects while they are alive," or just a weak set of objects (using them as keys and `true` as values): caches, deduplication sets, etc.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #18498]
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/ObjectSpace/WeakKeyMap.html"><code>ObjectSpace::WeakKeyMap</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  map = ObjectSpace::WeekMap.new

  key = "foo"
  map[key] = true
  map["foo"] #=> true -- compares by equality, even if two strings are different objects

  # "Just return the equal key" API, always returns the key's object
  map.getkey("foo") #=> "foo"
  map.getkey("foo").object_id == key.object_id #=> true

  key = nil
  GC.start

  map["foo"] #=> nil -- the key was garbage-collected, so the pair was removed

  # One of the possible usages: a lightweight uniqueness cache for
  # many small objects:
  class Money < Data.define(:amount, :currency)
    def self.new(...)
      value = super(...)
      @cache ||= ObjectSpace::WeakKeyMap.new
      if (existing = @cache.getkey(value))
        existing
      else
        @cache[value] = true
      end
    end
  end

  m1 = Money.new(10, 'USD')
  m2 = Money.new(10, 'USD')
  m1.object_id #=> 60
  m2.object_id #=> 60
  # Same values, it is the same object, so there wouldn't be a huge memory
  # penalty when thousands of similar values are created.

  # No references to "10 USD" object left
  m1 = nil
  m2 = nil
  GC.start
  m3 = Money.new(10, 'USD')
  m3.object_id #=> 80
  # The unused values got garbage-collected, so the cache wouldn't just grow forever
  ```
* **Notes:** The class interface is significantly leaner than `WeakMap`'s, and doesn't provide any kind of iteration methods (which is very hard to implement and use correctly with weakly-referenced objects), so the new class is more like a black box with associations than a collection.

#### `ObjectSpace::WeakMap#delete`[](#objectspaceweakmapdelete)

* **Reason:** `WeakMap` is frequently used to have a loose list of objects that will need some processing at some point of program execution if they are still alive/used (that's why `WeekMap` and not `Array`/`Hash` is chosen in those cases). But it is possible that the code author wants to process objects conditionally, and to remove those which don't need processing anymore—even if they are still alive. `WeekMap` quacks like kind-of simple `Hash`, yet previously provided no way to delete keys.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #19561]
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/ObjectSpace/WeakMap.html#method-i-delete"><code>ObjectSpace::WeakMap#delete</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  files_to_close = ObjectSpace::WeakMap.new
  file1 = File.new('README.md')
  file2 = File.new('NEWS.md')

  files_to_close[file1] = true
  files_to_close[file2] = true

  files_to_close.delete(file1) #=> true

  # Attempt to delete non-existing key:
  files_to_close.delete(file1) #=> nil
  # An optional block can be provided in case the key doesn't exist:
  files_to_close.delete(file1) { puts "Already removed"; 0 }
  # Prints "Already removed", returns `0`

  # The block wouldn't be called if the deletion was effectful:
  files_to_close.delete(file2) { puts "Already removed"; 0 }
  # Prints nothing, returns true
  ```
* **Notes:**

#### `Thread::Queue#freeze` and `SizedQueue#freeze` raise `TypeError`[](#threadqueuefreeze-and-sizedqueuefreeze-raise-typeerror)

* **Reason:** The discussion was started with a bug report about `Queue` not respecting `#freeze` in any way (`#push` and `#pop` were still working after `#freeze` call). It was then decided that allowing to freeze a queue like any other collection (leaving it immutable) would have questionable semantics. As `Queue` is meant to be an inter-thread communication utility, freezing a queue while some thread waits for it would either leave this thread hanging, or would require `#freeze`'s functionality to extend for communication with dependent threads. Neither is a good option, so the behavior of the method was changed to communicate that queue freezing doesn't make sense.
* **Discussion:** [Bug #17146]
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Thread/Queue.html#method-i-freeze"><code>Thread::Queue#freeze</code></a> and <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Thread/SizedQueue.html#method-i-freeze"><code>Thread::SizedQueue#freeze</code></a>

### `Range`[](#range)

#### `#reverse_each`[](#reverse_each)

Specialized `Range#reverse_each` method is implemented.

* **Reason:** Previously, `Range` didn't have a specialized `#reverse_each` method, so calling it invoked a generic `Enumerable#reverse_each`. The latter works by converting the object to array, and then enumerating this array. In case of a `Range` this can be inefficient (producing large arrays) or impossible (when only upper bound of the range is defined). It also went into infinite loop with endless ranges, trying to enumerate it all to convert into array, while the range can say beforehand that it would be impossible.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #18515]
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Range.html#method-i-reverse_each"><code>Range#reverse_each</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  # Efficient implementation for integers:

  (1..2**100).reverse_each.take(3)
  # Ruby 3.2: hangs on my machine, trying to produce an array
  # Ruby 3.3: #=> [1267650600228229401496703205376, 1267650600228229401496703205375, 1267650600228229401496703205374]
  #  (returns immediately)

  (...5).reverse_each.take(3)
  # Ruby 3.2: can't iterate from NilClass (TypeError)
  # Ruby 3.3: #=> [5, 4, 3]

  # Explicit error for endless ranges:

  (1...).reverse_each
  # Ruby 3.2: hangs forever, trying to produce an array
  # Ruby 3.3: `reverse_each': can't iterate from NilClass (TypeError)

  # The latter change affects any type of range beginning:
  ('a'...).reverse_each
  # Ruby 3.2: hangs forever, trying to produce an array
  # Ruby 3.3: `reverse_each': can't iterate from NilClass (TypeError)
  ```
* **Notes:** Other than raising `TypeError` for endless ranges (which works with any type of range beginning), the specialized behavior is only implemented for `Integer`. A possibility of a generalization was [discussed](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18515#note-4) by using object's `#pred` method (opposite to `#succ`, which the range uses to iterate forward), but the scope of this change would be bigger, as currently only `Integer` implements such method. It is possible that the adjustments would be made in the future versions.

#### `#overlap?`[](#overlap)

Checks for overlapping of two ranges.

* **Discussion:** [Feature #19839]
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Range.html#method-i-overlap-3F"><code>Range#overlap?</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  (1..3).overlap?(2..5) #=> true
  (1..3).overlap?(4..5) #=> false
  (..3).overlap?(3..)   #=> true

  (1...3).overlap?(3..5)
  #=> false, the first range doesn't include 3
  (1..3).overlap?(3...3)
  #=> false, the second range is empty (note it has an exclusive end)

  (1..3).overlap?('a'..'c')
  #=> false, ranges are incompatible (but not an exception)
  (1..3).overlap?(1)
  # `overlap?': wrong argument type Integer (expected Range) (TypeError)
  ```
* **Notes:** As documentation points out, the _technically empty_ `(...-Float::INFINITY)` range (nothing can be lower than `Float::INFINITY`, and it is not included) still considered overlapping with itself by this method:
  ```ruby
  (...-Float::INFINITY).overlap?(...-Float::INFINITY) #=> true
  # Same with other "nothing could be smaller" ranges:
  (..."").overlap?(..."") #=> true
  ```
  (Though, with Ruby's dynamic nature, one _technically can_ define an object that will report itself to be smaller than an empty string, and therefore belong to a range... Making it non-empty.)

### Filesystem and IO[](#filesystem-and-io)

#### `Dir.for_fd` and `Dir.fchdir`[](#dirfor_fd-and-dirfchdir)

Two methods to accept an integer file descriptor as an argument: `for_fd` creates a `Dir` object from it; `fchdir` changes the current directory to one specified by a descriptor.

* **Reason:** New methods allow to use UNIX file descriptors if they are returned from a C-level code or obtained from OS.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #19347]
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Dir.html#method-c-for_fd"><code>Dir.for_fd</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Dir.html#method-c-fchdir"><code>Dir.fchdir</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  fileno = Dir.new('doc/').fileno
  # In reality, this #fileno might come from other library

  dir = Dir.for_fd(fileno)
  #=> #<Dir:0x00007f8831b810a8> -- no readable path representation
  dir.path #=> nil
  dir.to_a
  #=> ["forwardable.rd.ja", "packed_data.rdoc", "marshal.rdoc", "format_specifications.rdoc", ....
  # It was performed in the Ruby's core folder, and lists the doc/ contents

  # Attempt to use a bogus fileno will result in error:
  Dir.for_fd(0)
  # `for_fd': Not a directory - fdopendir (Errno::ENOTDIR)

  # Same with fileno that doesn't designate a directory:
  Dir.for_fd(Dir.new('README.md').fileno)
  # in `initialize': Not a directory @ dir_initialize - README.md (Errno::ENOTDIR)

  # Same logic works for .fchdir
  Dir.fchdir(fileno) #=> 0
  Dir.pwd
  #=> "/home/zverok/projects/ruby/doc" -- the current path have changed successfully

  # A block form of fchdir is available, like for a regular .chdir:
  Dir.fchdir(Dir.new('NEWS').fileno) do |*args|
    p args #=> [] -- no arguments are passed into the block
    p Dir.pwd #=> "/home/zverok/projects/ruby/doc/NEWS"
    'return value'
  end #=> "return value"
  Dir.pwd #=> "/home/zverok/projects/ruby/doc" -- back to the path before the block
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * The functionality is only supported on POSIX platforms;
  * The initial [ticket](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19347) only proposed to find a way to be able to change a current directory to one specified by a descriptor (i.e., what eventually became `.fchdir`), but during the discussion a need were discovered for a generic instantiation of a `Dir` instance from the descriptor (what became `from_fd`), as well as a generic way to change the current directory to one specified by `Dir` instance ([`#chdir`](TODO), which is not related to descriptors but is generically useful).

#### `Dir#chdir`[](#dirchdir)

An instance method version of <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Dir.html#method-c-chdir"><code>Dir.chdir</code></a>: changes the current working directory to one specified by the `Dir` instance.

* **Discussion:** [Feature #19347]
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Dir.html#method-i-chdir"><code>Dir#chdir</code></a>

#### Deprecate subprocess creation with method dedicated to files[](#deprecate-subprocess-creation-with-method-dedicated-to-files)

* **Reason:** Methods that are dedicated for opening/reading a file by name historically supported the special syntax of the argument: if it started with pipe character `|`, the subprocess was created and could've been used to communicate with an external command. The functionality is still explained in <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Kernel.html#method-i-open">Ruby 3.2 docs</a>. It, though, created a security vulnerability: even when the program's author didn't rely on that behavior, the malicious string could've been passed by the attacker instead of an innocent filename.
* **Discussion:** [Feature #19630]
* **Affected methods:**
  * <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Kernel.html#method-i-open"><code>Kernel#open</code></a>
  * <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/IO.html#method-c-binread"><code>IO.binread</code></a>
  * <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/IO.html#method-c-foreach"><code>IO.foreach</code></a>
  * <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/IO.html#method-c-readlines"><code>IO.readlines</code></a>
  * <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/IO.html#method-c-read"><code>IO.read</code></a>
  * <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/IO.html#method-c-write"><code>IO.write</code></a>
  * <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/URI.html#method-c-open"><code>URI.open</code></a> (<a class="github" href="https://github.com/ruby/open-uri">open-uri</a> standard library)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  IO.read('| ls')
  #=> contents of the current folder

  Warning[:deprecated] = true # Or pass -w command-line option
  IO.read('| ls')
  # warning: Calling Kernel#open with a leading '|' is deprecated and will be removed in Ruby 4.0; use IO.popen instead
  #=> contents of the current folder
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * The documentation for the corresponding methods was adjusted accordingly. Compare the documentation for `Kernel#open` from <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Kernel.html#method-i-open"><code>3.2</code></a> (explains and showcases the `|` trick) and <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Kernel.html#method-i-open"><code>3.3</code></a> (just mentions that there is a vulnerability to command injection attack).
  * As advised by the warning, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/IO.html#method-c-popen"><code>IO.popen</code></a> is a specialized method when communicating with an external process is desired functionality:
    ```ruby
    IO.popen('ls')
    #=> contents of the current folder
    ```
  * As the impact of the change might be big, note that target version for removal is set to **4.0**. To the best of my knowledge, there are no set date for major version yet.

### `Fiber#kill`[](#fiberkill)

Terminates the Fiber by sending an exception inside it.

* **Reason:** The method is intended to be used to fibers that represent processes that need to be told explicitly to finalize themselves (invoking any `ensure` operations and cleanups that are necessary). If such fiber just abandoned and collected by a GC, it wouldn't invoke fiber's `ensure`, and therefore the resources wouldn't be cleaned; so there was need for a way to do this explicitly.
* **Discussion:** [Bug #595]
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Fiber.html#method-i-kill"><code>Fiber#kill</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  # TODO: base behaviors & edge cases!

  # Semi-realistic usage example:
  reader = Fiber.new do
    conn = SomeConnection.open(**params)
    while conn.open?
      Fiber.yield conn.read
    end
  ensure
    conn.close
  end

  headers = reader.resume # reads something from the connection
  body_line1 = reader.resume # reads some more
  # Now, if we want to explicitly stop reading and be sure that the connection
  # is closed, we might do this:
  reader.kill # invokes #ensure
  ```
* **Notes:**

### Internals[](#internals)

#### New `Warning` category: `:performance`[](#new-warning-category-performance)

A new warning category was introduced for a code that is correct but is known to produces a performance problems. One new such warning was added for objects with too many "shape" variations.

* **Discussion:** [Feature #19538]
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Warning.html#method-c-5B-5D"><code>Warning#[category]</code></a>
* **Code:** Here is an example of the new warning in play:
  ```ruby
  class C
    def initialize(i)
      instance_variable_set("@var_#{i}", i**2)
    end
  end

  Warning[:performance] = true # or pass `-W:performance` command-line argument

  (1..10).map { C.new(_1) }
  # warning: Maximum shapes variations (8) reached by C, instance variables accesses will be slower.
  ```
  The example is artificial, but it shows the principle: when we have more than 8 instances of the _same_ class, but with different _list of instance variables_ (shape), we might have a performance problem. This means, for example, that a frequently-used class that has many methods with a memoization idiom (`@var ||= value` on the first access) would create the same problem, unless all of them would be initialized in the `initialize`, making all instances having the same shape:
  ```ruby
  class C
    # 9 different getters that create an instance varaible
    # on the first access.
    def var1 = @var1 ||= rand
    def var2 = @var2 ||= rand
    def var3 = @var3 ||= rand
    def var4 = @var4 ||= rand
    def var5 = @var5 ||= rand
    def var6 = @var6 ||= rand
    def var7 = @var7 ||= rand
    def var8 = @var8 ||= rand
    def var9 = @var9 ||= rand
  end

  Warning[:performance] = true
  # Invoking different getters on different instances of the same class makes
  # them have different set of instance variables.
  (1..9).map { C.new.send("var#{_1}") }
  # warning: Maximum shapes variations (8) reached by C, instance variables accesses will be slower.

  # But if we add this to initialize:
  class C
    def initialize
      @var1, @var2, @var3, @var4, @var5, @var5, @var6, @var7, @var8, @var9 = nil
    end
  end

  (1..9).map { C.new.send("var#{_1}") }
  # no warning. All objects have the same list of instance vars = the same shape
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * The warning category should be turned on explicitly by providing `-W:performance` CLI option or `Warning[:performance] = true` from the program.
* **Additional reading:** [Performance impact of the memoization idiom on modern Ruby](https://railsatscale.com/2023-10-24-memoization-pattern-and-object-shapes/) by Ruby core team member Jean Boussier.


#### `Process.warmup`[](#processwarmup)

A method to call when a long-running application finalized its loading, and before the regular work is started. TODO: forks?

* **Discussion:** [Feature #18885]
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Process.html#method-c-warmup"><code>Process.warmup</code></a>
* **Notes:** Hardly something can be explained or showcased here better than the justification discussion linked above and the method docs are doing it.

#### `Process::Status#&`  and `#>>` are deprecated[](#processstatus--and--are-deprecated)

* **Reason:** These methods have been treating `Process::Status` as a very thin wrapper around an integer value of the return status of the process; which is unreasonable for supporting Ruby in more varying environments.
* **Discussion:** [Bug #19868]
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Process/Status.html#method-i-26"><code>Process::Status#&</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Process/Status.html#method-i-3E-3E"><code>#>></code></a>
* **Code:**

#### `TracePoint` supports `:rescue` event[](#tracepoint-supports-rescue-event)

Allows to trace when some exception was `rescue`'d in the code of interest.

* **Discussion:** [Feature #19572]
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/TracePoint.html#class-TracePoint-label-Events"><code>TracePoint#Events</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  TracePoint.trace(:rescue) do |tp|
    puts "Exception rescued: #{tp.raised_exception.inspect} at #{tp.path}:#{tp.lineno}"
  end

  begin
    raise "foo"
  rescue => e
  end
  # Prints: "Exception rescued: #<RuntimeError: foo> at example.rb:7
  ```
* **Notes:** The event-specific attribute for the event is the same as for `:raise`: <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/TracePoint.html#method-i-raised_exception"><code>#raised_exception</code></a>.


## Standard library[](#standard-library)

Since Ruby 3.1 release, most of the standard library is extracted to either _default_ or _bundled_ gems; their development happens in separate repositories, and changelogs are either maintained there, or absent altogether. Either way, their changes aren't mentioned in the combined Ruby changelog, and I'll not be trying to follow all of them.

> **[stdgems.org](https://stdgems.org/)** project has a nice explanations of default and bundled gems concepts, as well as a list of currently gemified libraries and links to their docs.

> "For the rest of us" this means libraries development extracted into separate GitHub repositories, and they are just packaged with main Ruby before release. It means you can do issue/PR to any of them independently, without going through more tough development process of the core Ruby.

A few changes to mention, though:

* <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/BasicSocket.html#method-i-recv"><code>BasicSocket#recv</code></a> and <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/BasicSocket.html#method-i-recv_nonblock"><code>BasicSocket#recv_nonblock</code></a> returns `nil` instead of an empty string on closed connections. <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/BasicSocket.html#method-i-recvmsg"><code>BaicSocket#recvmsg</code></a> and BasicSocket#recvmsg_nonblock returns `nil` instead of an empty packet on closed connections. Discussion: [Bug #19012]
* Name resolution such as <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Socket.html#method-c-getaddrinfo"><code>Socket.getaddrinfo</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Socket.html#method-c-getnameinfo"><code>Socket.getnameinfo</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Addrinfo.html#method-c-getaddrinfo"><code>Addrinfo.getaddrinfo</code></a> can now be interrupted. Discussion: [Feature #19965]
* <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Random/Formatter.html#method-i-alphanumeric"><code>Random::Formatter#alphanumeric</code></a>: `chars` keyword argument. [Feature #18183]:
  ```ruby
  require 'random/formatter'
  # The default behavior: uses English alphabet + numbers
  Random.alphanumeric
  #=> "fhCshEkcGfCTO6Ny"

  # With the argument provided:
  Random.alphanumeric(chars: ['a', 'b', 'c'])
  #=> "cbacacbababccccc"

  # Note that the argument should be an array.
  # So if you have a string of characters, you can do:
  Random.alphanumeric(chars: 'abc'.chars)
  #=> "abbaccaacbacbccc"

  # Any object is acceptable as an array element, the method
  # would just use their `#to_s`; arrays would be flattened:
  Random.alphanumeric(chars: [1, true, [2], Object.new])
  #=> "111true11211true2true#<Object:0x00007fe804e79f48>221"

  # An empty array just hangs forever:
  Random.alphanumeric(chars: []) # never returns
  ```

### Standard library content changes[](#standard-library-content-changes)

#### Additions[](#additions)

* <a class="github" href="https://github.com/ruby/prism">prism</a> (nee YARP) is added. It is a new Ruby code parser, developed by Kevin Newton, which intends to become _the_ Ruby parser, shared by all implementations (not only CRuby/MRI, but also TruffleRuby, JRuby, and others) and tools that need to parser Ruby code (like Sorbet or Rubocop). It doesn't replace CRuby's Ruby parser at least for now, but can be used to parse Ruby quickly and produce robust, easy to use AST.

#### Removals[](#removals)

* `readline` extension is removed. It was a standard library written in C to wrap [GNU Readline](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html), used to implement interactive consoles like IRB. Ruby includes pure-Ruby replacement called <a class="github" href="https://github.com/ruby/reline">reline</a> [since 2.7](2.7.html#new-libraries), and now `require 'readline'` will just require it and make an alias `Readline = Reline`. Though, if the <a class="github" href="https://github.com/ruby/readline-ext">readline-ext</a> gem is installed explicitly, `require 'readline'` would require it. Discussion: [Feature #19616].
  ```ruby
  require 'readline'

  Readline
  # Ruby 3.2:
  #   => Readline -- a separate library/constant
  # Ruby 3.3:
  #   => Reline -- Readline is just an alias

  Readline.method(:readline)
  # Ruby 3.2:
  #   => #<Method: Readline.readline(*)>  -- a C-defined method with no location/signature extracted
  # Ruby 3.3:
  #   => #<Method: Reline.readline(*args, &block) <...>/lib/ruby/3.3.0+0/forwardable.rb:231>
  ```

#### Default gems that became bundled[](#default-gems-that-became-bundled)

_This means that if your dependencies are managed by Bundler and your code depend on `racc`, it should be added to a `Gemfile`._

#### Gems that are warned to become bundled in the next version[](#gems-that-are-warned-to-become-bundled-in-the-next-version)

These gems wouldn't in a Bundler-managed environment unless explicitly added to `Gemfile` since the next version of Ruby. For now, requiring them in such environment would produce a warning.
