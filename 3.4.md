**🇺🇦 🇺🇦 Before you start reading the changelog: A full-scale Russian invasion into my home country continues, for the second year in a row. The only reason I am alive and able to work on the changelog is Armed Forces of Ukraine, and international support with weaponry, funds and information. I got into the Army in March, and spent the summer on the frontlines. Now I have moved to another army position which frees some time to work for the Ruby community. Here is [my recent post](https://zverok.space/blog/2025-01-06-changelog-2025.html) about making the changelog (and links to some Ukrainian fundraisers).🇺🇦 🇺🇦**

> **Note:** As already explained in [Introduction](README.md), this site is dedicated to changes in the **language**, not the **implementation**, therefore the list below lacks mentions of lots of important _internal_ changes. The changes aren't covered extensively not because they are not important, just because this site's goals are different. See [the official release notes](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2024/12/25/ruby-3-4-0-released/) that cover those significant internal changes. This year, though, changes are quite noticeable from the language user's perspective, so some of them are briefly mentioned in a [separate section](#cruby-implementation-changes).

## Language changes[](#language-changes)

### Standalone `it` in blocks became anonymous argument[](#standalone-it-in-blocks-became-anonymous-argument)

After a long discussion (and introduction of warning [in Ruby 3.3](3.3.html#standalone-it-in-blocks-will-become-anonymous-argument-in-ruby-34)), `it` was added as a name for anonymous parameter in a block.

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18980">Feature #18980</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Proc.html#class-Proc-label-it">Proc: `it`</a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  [1, 2, 3].map { it**2 } #=> [1, 4, 9]
  # numbered params still work:
  [1, 2, 3].map { _1**2 } #=> [1, 4, 9]
  # the two aren't allowed to be mixed together:
  [1, 2, 3].map { _1 + it } # SyntaxError
  #                    ^~ `it` is not allowed when a numbered parameter is already used

  # it is a "soft" keyword, it is allowed to use as a name for variable or a method,
  # even inside a block:
  [1, 2, 3].each {
    x = it # referes to block argument
    it = x**2 # assigns local variable
    p it # now refers to a local variable
  }
  # prints
  #  1
  #  4
  #  9

  # But if `it` is available as a local variable in the same scope,
  # it takes precedence:
  it = 5
  [1, 2, 3].map { it**2 } #=> [25, 25, 25]

  # If `it` is defined as a method, anonymous parameter takes precedence:
  def it = 6
  [1, 2, 3].map { it**2 } #=> [1, 4, 9]

  # unlike _1, `it` is allowed in nested blocks:
  [[1, 2], [3, 4]].each { it.each { p it } }
  # prints:
  #   1
  #   2
  #   3
  #   4
  # inner `it` refers to variable in the inner block

  # Wouldn't work this way with numbered parameters:
  [[1, 2], [3, 4]].each { _1.each { p _1 } }
  # prints
  #   [1, 2]
  #   [1, 2]
  #   [3, 4]
  #   [3, 4]
  # because inner _1 is the same as the outer one

  # `it` is represented in .parameters this way:
  proc { it**2 }.parameters   #=> [[:opt, nil]]
  lambda { it**2 }.parameters #=> [[:req]]
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * A lot of effort was put into backward compatibility of the new syntax: `it` still works as a local variable and method name, so there is very small chance for old code being broken. See <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Proc.html#class-Proc-label-it">feature documentation</a> for more details and examples.
  * There is still a bit some rough edges around `it` inspectability, discussed [here](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20965) (`binding.local_variables`) and [here](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20955) (`Proc#parameters`, as shown above), as well as parsing logic in some edge cases (discussed [here](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20970)):
    ```ruby
    proc { it + 1 }.call(3) #=> 4
    proc { it +1 }.call(3)
    # undefined method 'it' for main (NoMethodError)
    # Because without space in `+1` it is parsed as `it(+1)`

    # Even though it is resolved correctly with real local variables:
    it = 3
    it +1 #=> 4
    ```
* **Follow-up:** In [4.0](4.0.html#binding-separate-local-variables-from-implicit-parameters), the behavior of `binding.local_variables` was made consistent (it doesn't return neither `_1` nor `it`), and `binding.implicit_parameters` was introduced.

### `**nil` unpacks into empty keyword arguments[](#nil-unpacks-into-empty-keyword-arguments)

* **Reason:** There is a frequently useful argument where positional arguments are provided conditionally by `method(*(some_value if some_condition))`. Before this change, it was not possible to do the same with keyword arguments, so the additional convenience was introduced.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker bug" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20064">Bug #20064</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/syntax/calling_methods_rdoc.html#label-Unpacking+Keyword+Arguments">Calling Methods: Unpacking Keyword Arguments</a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  def handle_options(**kwargs) = p kwargs

  handle_options(**nil)
  # Ruby 3.3: no implicit conversion of nil into Hash (TypeError)
  # Ruby 3.4: prints {}

  # Practical usage: we have conditional options passing:
  # Ruby 3.3: that's the shortest we can do:
  handle_options(**(some_condition? ? extra_options : {}))
  # Ruby 3.4: `nil` is unpacked as no keyword arguments
  handle_options(**(extra_options if some_condition?))
  ```
* **Notes:** There is an convention that `**value` invokes `value.to_hash` (explicit hash conversion method) while trying to unpack the value. This is **not** how it was implemented in this case: `nil` doesn't implement `#to_hash`, and `**nil` doesn't produce empty hash, just treated by Ruby as passing no keyword arguments. This allows to avoid unnecessary empty hash allocation.
* **Follow-up:** In [4.0](4.0.html#nil-no-longer-calls-nilto_a), `*nil` was optimized by `**nil` example to not produce an intermediate array.

### Keyword and block arguments are prohibited in `#[]=`[](#keyword-and-block-arguments-are-prohibited-in-)

* **Reason:**
  * A possibility to use keyword arguments while calling `[]=` (e.g., `my_matrix[5, axis: :y] = value`) leads to wrong expectations: Ruby have always parsed it as a positional hash, because the last argument to `[]=` should be the value set, and it is positional. Prohibiting the misleading syntax allows to avoid false expectations.
  * For blocks, there was no valid syntax to call `[]=` with a literal block, but passing `&value` was allowed, leading to confusing precedence and, in general, providing only implementation complications to no gain.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker bug" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19918">Bug #19918</a> (block argument), <a class="tracker bug" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20218">Bug #20218</a> (keyword argument)
* **Documentation:** —
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  class MyMatrix
    # ...some implementation

    def []=(*args, **kwargs)
      p(args:, kwargs:)
      # ...some implementation
    end
  end

  matrix = MyMatrix.new
  matrix[5, axis: :y] = 8
  # Ruby 3.3: prints
  #   {:args=>[5, {:axis=>:y}, 8], :kwargs=>{}}
  # Unlike somebody's expectation, it does NOT put `axis:` into keyword arguments
  #
  # Ruby 3.4: keyword arg given in index assignment (SyntaxError)

  # If you meant to have it as a positional hash argument, it should be wrapped:
  matrix[5, {axis: :y}] = 8
  # {args: [5, {axis: :y}, 8], kwargs: {}}

  # With blocks, one could previously do something like:
  class MyCollection
    # ...some implementation

    def []=(index, value, &block)
      p "setting at #{index} to #{block.call(value)}"
      # ...or some real implementation
    end
  end

  # There is no valid syntax to provide this block:
  col = MyCollection.new
  col[1] { _1.floor } = 2.5
  # unexpected write target (SyntaxError)

  # But this was possible:
  col[1, &:floor] = 2.5
  # Ruby 3.3: prints "setting at 1 to 2"
  # Ruby 3.4: unexpected block arg given in index assignment; blocks are not allowed in index assignment expressions (SyntaxError)
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * `#[]=` method still can be defined to accept keyword arguments (it doesn't raise an error). Such methods even can be called by using `send`, though there is no real utility in doing so:
    ```ruby
    matrix.public_send(:[]=, 5, 8, axis: :y)
    # {args: [5, 8], kwargs: {axis: :y}}
    ```
  * During the discussion, it was noted that syntax like `matrix[5, axis: :y] = 8` _might_ be useful, and there is a possible alternative: Instead of prohibiting “keyword-looking” arguments, Ruby could have a convention that the `[]=` method is allowed to have this signature:
    ```ruby
    def []=(*args, value, **kwargs)
      # ...
    end

    matrix[5, axis: :y] = 8
    #      ^  ^^^^^^^^    ^
    #      |  kwargs      |
    #     args          value
    ```
    Such "inversion" (when keyword arguments are moved _after_ the actually positional `value`) was considered too complicated to implement and document so far, but it might be rethought in the future, if requested by language users.
  * Block and keyword arguments are still allowed in `#[]`, as they create no confusion:
    ```ruby
    class Matrix
      def [](*a, **kwa, &b)
        p [a, kwa, b]
      end
    end

    m = Matrix.new
    m[5, axis: :y] { p "fetching the value" }
    #=> [[5], {axis: :y}, #<Proc:0x00...>]
    #     ^   keywords       block
    #   positional
    ```

### Warnings about unused blocks[](#warnings-about-unused-blocks)

There is now a warning (opt-in, enabled by a special warning category `:strict_unused_block`) when the block is passed to a method that doesn't expect it.

* **Reason:** As any method can implicitly accept block parameter, it might create hard to detect bugs, when the block is passed to a method that stopped accepting it after an API update, or to one that never accepted it in the first place (like using `Time.freeze { some tests }` instead of specialized test library `Timecop.freeze { some tests }`). The warning allows to indicate such cases.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15554">Feature #15554</a>
* **Documentation:** —
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  Warning[:strict_unused_block] = true

  def yields
    yield
  end

  def accepts(&block)
  end

  def conditional
    yield if Time.now.tuesday?
  end

  def checks
    p block_given?
  end

  def ignores
  end

  yields {  } # no warning
  accepts {  } # no warning, even if the block is just put in the variable
  conditional { } # no warning, even if it doesn't use the block on some of the code paths
  checks { }
  # test.rb:19: warning: the block passed to 'Object#checks' defined at test.rb:10 may be ignored
  ignores {  }
  # test.rb:20: warning: the block passed to 'Object#ignores' defined at test.rb:14 may be ignored
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * Note there is no warning for `accept` method above: it isn't necessary even to use the block, accepting explicitly is enough. This is because the feature's primary intention is to avoid accidental passing blocks to methods whose author doesn't even considered this possibility; while accepting the block explicitly and not calling it (at least in some code paths) means that the method's author considered it. There is still a warning though if the method checks whether the block is given yet never uses it (see `checks` method).
  * There was alternative/complementary idea [discussed](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19979): to allow declare "this method doesn't accept blocks" explicitly with `&nil` (akin to `**nil` for "doesn't accept keyword arguments"). So far, it was not accepted: it might be useful to specify on API changes (when some method that previously accepted blocks stopped doing so), but would hardly be useful in general, as it is hard to guess which methods should be marked, and too ugly to mark _all_ methods that doesn't accept blocks.

### Warning to prepare for freezing string literals in Ruby 3.5[](#warning-to-prepare-for-freezing-string-literals-in-ruby-35)

String created as string literals in Ruby 3.4 emit deprecation warnings when modified; this will probably become an error in Ruby 3.5. _In developer discussions, such strings—not frozen, but emitting a warning—are frequently called **"chilled"** strings, though it is not an official term._ `Symbol#to_s` also returns a "chilled" string.

* **Reason:**
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20205">Feature #20205</a>, <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20350">Feature #20350</a> ("chilled" `Symbol#to_s`)
* **Documentation:** —
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  Warning[:deprecated] = true # or -W:deprecated when running ruby

  buf = ""
  buf << "test"
  # warning: literal string will be frozen in the future

  buf = +"" # this makes a string "not chilled"
  buf << "test" # no warning

  # any operation on chilled literals produce not chilled one:
  ("" + "") << "test" # no warning

  # string interpolation also produce non-chilled strings:
  "#{1}" << "test" # no warning

  # Besides literals, chilled string also returned from Symbol#to_s
  s = :foo.to_s
  s << "_sym"
  # warning: string returned by :foo.to_s will be frozen in the future
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * The warning might be suppressed (even when the "deprecated" warnings category is enabled with an command-line option `--disable-frozen-string-literal`.
  * The full warning (not shown in examples for clarity) is this: "warning: literal string will be frozen in the future (run with `--debug-frozen-string-literal` for more information)". When the suggested command-line option is used, there is an additional warning output, allowing to indicate where the literal is coming from, like this:
    ```ruby
    Warning[:deprecated] = true # or -W:deprecated when running ruby

    buf = ""      # line 3
    buf << "test" # line 4

    # test.rb:4: warning: literal string will be frozen in the future
    # test.rb:3: info: the string was created here
    ```
  * There is no straightforward way to "chill" the string manually (though `string.to_sym.to_s` can be used to achieve this) or check if the string is chilled.
  * The discussion is [still ongoing](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20205#note-65) about the overall influence of the freezing of the string literals on the ecosystem. So it is not set in stone yet that it will happen in 3.5.
* **Follow-up:** In the next Ruby version (which became 4.0, not 3.5), the strings eventualy **did not** became frozen.

### Reserved module `::Ruby`[](#reserved-module-ruby)

The top-level constant `Ruby` is reserved for future use by the language and emits warning when redefined.

* **Reason:** It was noted that there are many constants with name like `RUBY_SOMETHING`, and "auxiliary" classes like `Thread::Backtrace::Location` (that aren't really related to thread, but provide the call stack locations as structured objects), and there are no common grouping module for them in an implementation-independent way (there is ::RubyVM module, but it is specifically documented as a place to define _implementation-specific_ constants and modules).
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20884">Feature #20884</a>
* **Documentation:** —
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  Ruby
  # uninitialized constant Ruby (NameError) -- it is not yet defined

  Warning[:deprecated] = true # or -W:deprecated when running ruby
  Ruby = 1
  # warning: ::Ruby is reserved for Ruby 3.5
  ```
* **Notes:** There is still no clear vision of what exactly would be put in the module (several proposals were discussed and [rejected](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20884#note-11)), so it is not necessary that the module would be introduced in the Ruby 3.5.
* **Follow-up:** The module was introduced in [4.0](4.0.html#ruby-new-top-level-module), containing constants like `Ruby::VERSION`, and a [new concept of `Ruby::Box`](4.0.html#rubybox-a-new-concept-for-isolated-code-loading).

### Removals[](#removals)

* `Refinement#refined_class` which was introduced [in 3.2](3.2.html#refinementrefined_class) and deprecated in favor of `#target` [in 3.3](3.3.html#refinementrefined_class-is-renamed-to-refinementtarget), is removed.

## Core classes and modules[](#core-classes-and-modules)

### `Object#singleton_method`: includes methods from prepended/included modules[](#objectsingleton_method-includes-methods-from-prependedincluded-modules)

* **Reason:** Just fixing an old inconsistency.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker bug" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20620">Bug #20620</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Object.html#method-i-singleton_method"><code>Object#singleton_method</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  module Extensions
    def foo; end
  end

  o = Object.new
  def o.bar; end
  o.extend Extensions

  p o.singleton_methods       # both methods are listed
  #=> [:bar, :foo]
  p o.singleton_method(:bar)  # method defined on the object directly is returned
  #=> #<Method: #<Object:0x00...>.bar()>
  p o.singleton_method(:foo)  # included method was not available before
  # Ruby 3.3: undefined singleton method `foo' for `#<Object:0x00007f5bcc79da68>' (NameError)
  # Ruby 3.4: #<Method: Object(Extensions)#foo()>

  # A more practical example:
  # an idiom for a module that can be included somewhere or used on itself
  module Utils
    def format(...); end

    extend self # makes all methods available as Utils.format
  end

  Utils.singleton_methods #=> [:format]
  Utils.singleton_method(:format)
  # Ruby 3.3: undefined singleton method `format' for `Utils' (NameError)
  # Ruby 3.4: #<Method: #<Class:Utils>(Utils)#format(...)>
  ```

### Float parsing changes[](#float-parsing-changes)

Methods `Float(str)` and `str.to_f` now allow floats without digits after the decimal point, e.g., `"1."` or `"1.E-3"`.

* **Reason:** Initially, it was proposed to change which float formats Ruby supports in general (akin to many other languages that support `1.` as a literal). It was considered impossible because the dot after number might mean a method call; but it was decided that enhancing float-to-string parsing is acceptable.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20705">Feature #20705</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Kernel.html#method-i-Float"><code>Kernel#Float</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/String.html#method-i-to_f"><code>String#to_f</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  Float('1.')
  # Ruby 3.3: in `Float': invalid value for Float(): "1." (ArgumentError)
  # Ruby 3.4: => 1.0
  Float('1.E2')
  # Ruby 3.3: ArgumentError
  # Ruby 3.4: => 100.0

  '1.'.to_f
  # 3.3&3.4: 1.0 -- Ruby 3.3 just ignored "."
  '1.E2'.to_f
  # Ruby 3.3: 1.0     -- Ruby 3.3 ignores ".E2"
  # Ruby 3.4: 100.0
  ```
* **Notes:** The change might be _subtly_ breaking in some code, if the input data contains text like `"1.e2"` which previously wasn't parsed as an exponential notation of a float (as shown above, the result of parsing for such strings have changed). But the probability to encounter such incompatibility is low.

### `String#append_as_bytes`[](#stringappend_as_bytes)

An efficient way to modify the string by appending the argument, treating it as bytes.

* **Reason:** The feature is useful while working on binary protocols: either constructing the binary message from bytes and strings in various encoding; or constructing a string receiving it byte-by-byte from some stream/binary format.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20594">Feature #20594</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/String.html#method-i-append_as_bytes"><code>String#append_as_bytes</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  buf = "msg@>".b
  content = "Україна"

  # Without append_as_bytes:
  buf.encoding #=> #<Encoding:BINARY (ASCII-8BIT)>
  buf << content
  buf.encoding #=> #<Encoding:UTF-8> -- implicitly converted the buffer

  # When there are unconvertable bytes (markers in binary protocol),
  # this wouldn't work at all:
  "msg@>".b << 255 << content
  # incompatible character encodings: BINARY (ASCII-8BIT) and UTF-8 (Encoding::CompatibilityError)

  # With append_as_bytes
  buf = "msg@>".b.append_as_bytes(255).append_as_bytes(content)
  #=> "msg@>\xFF\xD0\xA3\xD0\xBA\xD1\x80\xD0\xB0\xD1\x97\xD0\xBD\xD0\xB0"
  buf.encoding #=> #<Encoding:BINARY (ASCII-8BIT)>

  # Behavior details:
  # append_as_bytes never changes the encoding even if the content is
  # not valid in a given encoding.
  # Say, byte-by-byte building of string from some stream:
  buf = +"У"                   # UTF-8 string
  buf.append_as_bytes("\xD0")  #=> "У\xD0" -- not valid UTF-8 content
  buf.valid_encoding?          #=> false
  buf.append_as_bytes("\xBA")  #=> "Ук"
  buf.valid_encoding?          #=> true again

  # With integer argument, uses only lower byte of the integer as a byte to append
  buf.append_as_bytes(32)
  "Ук "

  buf.append_as_bytes(289) # two bytes: 0x01_21, only the lower (0x21) is appended
  "Ук !"

  # No argument conversions is performed for other types than String or Integer
  buf.append_as_bytes(:test)
  # wrong argument type Symbol (expected String or Integer) (TypeError)
  buf.append_as_bytes(1r)
  # wrong argument type Rational (expected String or Integer) (TypeError)
  ```

### `MatchData#bytebegin` and `#byteend` have been added[](#matchdatabytebegin-and-byteend-have-been-added)

Singular begin/end values of match group offsets to complement `#byteoffset` [introduced in Ruby 3.2](3.2.html#byte-oriented-methods).

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20576">Feature #20576</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/MatchData.html#method-i-bytebegin"><code>MatchData#bytebegin</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/MatchData.html#method-i-byteend"><code>MatchData#byteend</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  str = 'Слава Україні'
  match = str.match(/Слава\s+(?<name>.+)/)
  match.begin(1) #=> 6
  match.bytebegin(1) #=> 11
  match.end(1) #=> 13
  match.byteend(1) #=> 25
  match.bytebegin(:name) #=> 11
  match.byteend(:name) #=> 25
  ```
* **Notes:** The method names are spelled this way (and, not, say `byte_begin`) following the traditions of methods like `String#bytesplice`, `MatchData#byteoffset`, and such.

### `Time#xmlschema` ( `#iso8601`) in core[](#timexmlschema--iso8601-in-core)

The methods were moved from `time` standard library to the core of the `Time` class and rewritten in C.

* **Reason:** Those methods are extremely frequently used in serialization, and therefore considering them core, and rewriting in C, allows to better optimize and improve developer experience.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20707">Feature #20707</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Time.html#method-i-xmlschema"><code>Time#xmlschema</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Time.html#method-i-iso8601"><code>Time#iso8601</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  # no `require "time"` necessary
  Time.now.xmlschema    #=> "2024-12-15T20:19:36+02:00"
  Time.now.xmlschema(3) #=> "2024-12-15T20:19:36.113+02:00" -- argument is number of digits
  Time.now.iso8601      #=> "2024-12-15T20:19:36+02:00" -- just an alias
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * Unfortunately <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Time.html#method-i-xmlschema">the documentation</a> still refers to `time` standard library, even though the method is now defined in C; this is just a documentation rendering problem.
  * <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Time.html#method-c-xmlschema"><code>Time.xmlschema</code></a> (symmetrical parsing method) is confusingly still defined in `time` standard library, in Ruby.

### `Range`[](#range)

#### `#size` raises `TypeError` if the range is not iterable[](#size-raises-typeerror-if-the-range-is-not-iterable)

I.e., if the range's `begin` doesn't respond to `#succ`—which means it can't be iterated with `#each` and related methods, and therefore doesn't have a sense as a "sequence of values."

* **Reason:** The clarification of the behavior was a consequence of fixing a bug: before the change, calculating the size (by subtracting ends) have happened for any numerics, including floats. It produced confusing results. Instead of just returning `nil`, a new behavior was introduced.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker misc" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18984">Misc #18984</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Range.html#method-i-size"><code>Range#size</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  (1..5).size
  # 3.3 & 3.4: => 5

  ('a'..'z').size # a sequence, but can't calculate size efficiently
  # 3.3 & 3.4: => nil

  (Time.now..Time.now + 1).size # not a sequence
  # Ruby 3.3: => nil
  # Ruby 3.4: in 'Range#size': can't iterate from Time (TypeError)

  # The bug that initialized the discussion:
  (0.5..1.3).size
  # Ruby 3.3: => 1 -- doesn't make much sense, it is neither the number of steps in range,
  #              nor an arithmetic distance between 1.3 and 0.5
  # Ruby 3.4: 'Range#size': can't iterate from Float (TypeError)
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * Note that `Range#size` still returns `nil` for ranges that can be iterated, but their size can't be calculated efficiently, like string ones. `Range#size` is calculated only for integer ranges (by subtracting `begin` from `end`). To calculate count of items in any iterable range (by traversing the range), use `Range#count`:
    ```ruby
    ('a'..'z').count #=> 26
    (Time.now..Time.now + 1).count
    # in 'Range#each': can't iterate from Time (TypeError)
    # ...which is now consistent with #size
    ```
  * One slightly confusing consequence is behavior change for semi-open Integer ranges. The discussion of whether it is intentional is [here](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20980):
    ```ruby
    (3..).size #=> Infinity
    (..3).size
    # Ruby 3.3: Infinity
    # Ruby 3.4: can't iterate from NilClass (TypeError) -- maybe somewhat worse
    ```

#### `#step`: iterating by using `+` operator for all types[](#step-iterating-by-using--operator-for-all-types)

For a long time, there was a behavioral inconsistency in ranges: with numbers, the `step` argument meant "what to add on each step", while for all other types, it was expected to be integer, and meant "how many steps to iterate using `#succ` method." Now steps are consistently iterated by using `begin + step`, which allows to go through ranges of various types like types, units, mathematical vectors and so on.

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18368">Feature #18368</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Range.html#method-i-step"><code>Range#step</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  # Always worked with numbers:
  (1..2).step(0.2).to_a
  #=> [1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0]

  # But with other types it expected `step` argument to be integer:
  ('a'..'e').step(2).to_a
  #=> ["a", "c", "e"]

  # Now it also works with +, allowing, say, this:
  require 'time'
  (Time.parse('2024-12-01')..Time.parse('2024-12-03')).step(6*60*60).to_a
  # Or, with ActiveSupport:
  (Time.parse('2024-12-01')..Time.parse('2024-12-03')).step(6.hours).to_a
  # Ruby 3.3: in `step': can't iterate from Time (TypeError)
  # Ruby 3.4: => [2024-12-01 00:00:00 +0200, 2024-12-01 06:00:00 +0200, 2024-12-01 12:00:00 +0200, 2024-12-01 18:00:00 +0200, 2024-12-02 00:00:00 +0200]

  # For backward compatibility, String supports both types of iteration:
  ('a'..'e').step(2).to_a
  # Ruby 3.3&3.4: => ["a", "c", "e"] -- old behavior preserved

  ('='..'=====').step('=').to_a
  # Ruby 3.3: in `step': no implicit conversion of String into Integer (TypeError)
  # Ruby 3.4: => ["=", "==", "===", "====", "====="]
  ```

### `Array#fetch_values`[](#arrayfetch_values)

A method that behaves like a mix between <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Array.html#method-i-values_at"><code>Array#values_at</code></a> (allows to get several values at once) and <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Array.html#method-i-fetch"><code>Array#fetch</code></a> (raises when the index is absent, or uses the provided default value), akin to <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Hash.html#method-i-fetch_values"><code>Hash#fetch_values</code></a>.

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20702">Feature #20702</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Array.html#method-i-fetch_values"><code>Array#fetch_values</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  ary = %w[a b c]
  ary.fetch_values(1, 0, 1, 2)
  #=> ["b", "a", "b", "c"] -- values are corresponding to indexes

  ary.fetch_values(1, 9, 5)
  # in 'Array#fetch': index 5 outside of array bounds: -3...3 (IndexError)

  ary.fetch_values(1, 9, 5) { "default for #{it}" }
  #=> ["b", "default for 5", "default for 9"]
  ```
* **Notes:** Unlike <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Array.html#method-i-values_at"><code>Array#values_at</code></a>, the method only allows integer indexes (not ranges). The discussion of whether it should be adjusted is [ongoing](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20953):
  ```ruby
  ary = %w[a b c d]
  ary.values_at(1, 2..5)
  #=> ["b", "c", "d", nil, nil] -- two last values don't exist

  # But so far #fetch_values doesn't allow to replace them with defaults
  # in the same protocol:
  ary.fetch_values(1, 2..5) { '<default>' }
  # 'Array#fetch': no implicit conversion of Range into Integer (TypeError)
  ```

### `Hash`[](#hash)

#### `.new` accepts an optional `capacity:` argument[](#new-accepts-an-optional-capacity-argument)

Like `String.new(capacity:)` and `Array.new(capacity)`, allows to pre-allocate hash if it is expected to be of some large size (and its order of magnitude is known).

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19236">Feature #19236</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Hash.html#method-c-new"><code>Hash.new</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  h = Hash.new(capacity: 1000)
  #=> {} -- just an empty hash, but internally preallocated for 1000 keys
  ```
* **Notes:** It is worth noticing that introduction of a keyword arguments in `Hash.new` signature changed the behavior with passing _another hash_ (as a default value for an absent key):
  ```ruby
  # Ruby 3.3:
  settings = Hash.new(value: '<default>') # treated as a positional Hash argument
  settings[:some_key] #=> {:value=>"default"}

  # It was already a warning though:
  Warning[:deprecated] = true # or -W:deprecated when running ruby
  settings = Hash.new(value: '<default>')
  # warning: Calling Hash.new with keyword arguments is deprecated and will be removed in Ruby 3.4; use Hash.new({ key: value }) instead

  # Ruby 3.4:
  settings = Hash.new(value: '<default>')
  # unknown keyword: :value (ArgumentError)

  # The correct way to pass the default value which is hash:
  settings = Hash.new({value: '<default>'})
  # The reason for the change is easy to see if used together with `capacity:`:
  settings = Hash.new({value: '<default>'}, capacity: 1000)
  #                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  #                     default: a hash     keyword arguments
  ```

#### `#inspect` rendering have been changed[](#inspect-rendering-have-been-changed)

At long last, the `#inspect` of Hash is adjusted to correspond to the modern syntax of hashes with `symbol: value`. On the way, other (non-symbol) keys rendering was also slightly adjusted, adding the spaces around the `=>`.

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker bug" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20433">Bug #20433</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Hash.html#method-i-inspect"><code>Hash#inspect</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  p({x: 1, 'foo-bar': 2, "baz" => 3})
  # Ruby 3.3: {:x=>1, :"foo-bar"=>2, "baz"=>3}
  # Ruby 3.4: {x: 1, "foo-bar": 2, "baz" => 3}
  ```
* **Notes:** While the change might be considered decorative (and therefore not significant, even if improving the DX), it should be considered by some codebases, because it might break some tests relying on particular Hash representation.

### Backtrace-related changes[](#backtrace-related-changes)

#### Exception `#backtrace_locations` can be set programmatically[](#exception-backtrace_locations-can-be-set-programmatically)

When raising exception with `raise` or modifying it with `Exception#set_backtrace`, it is now possible to pass an array of <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Thread/Backtrace/Location.html"><code>Thread::Backtrace::Location</code></a> objects to set both `#backtrace` (string values) and `#backtrace_locations` (structured values).

* **Reason:** Previously, the only option to customize exception's backtrace (to exclude some library's internals, or adjusting some DSL's logical error place to where it is invoked, not where it is implemented), was to pass the array of strings to `Kernel#raise` or `Exception#set_backtrace`. In this case, only `Exception#backtrace` (which is also represented by array of strings) would've been set, while `Exception#backtrace_locations` (structured location information) was impossible to set programmatically.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13557">Feature #13557</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/exceptions_md.html#label-Backtraces">Exceptions: Backtraces</a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Exception.html#method-i-set_backtrace"><code>Exception#set_backtrace</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Kernel.html#method-i-raise"><code>Kernel#raise</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Thread.html#method-i-raise"><code>Thread#raise</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Fiber.html#method-i-raise"><code>Fiber#raise</code></a> (the latter two methods are also affected, but their docs just refer to `Kernel#raise`)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  def raising_method
    # raise with the current stack with the last location ignored:
    raise RuntimeError, "Modified error", caller_locations(1)
  end

  def wrapper_method
    raising_method
  end

  begin
    wrapper_method
  rescue => ex
    # Both backtrace and backtrace_locations are adjusted, hiding the #raising_method
    p ex.backtrace
    #=> ["test.rb:6:in 'Object#wrapper_method'", "test.rb:10:in '<main>'"]
    p ex.backtrace_locations
    #=> ["test.rb:6:in 'Object#wrapper_method'", "test.rb:10:in '<main>'"]

    # backtrace_locations is structured object
    p ex.backtrace_locations.first.then { [it.path, it.lineno, it.label] }
    #=> ["test.rb", 6, "Object#wrapper_method"]

    ex.set_backtrace(ex.backtrace_locations[1..])
    raise
  end
  # Fails with an error that just says the last location:
  # test.rb:10:in '<main>': Modified error (RuntimeError)
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * I wouldn't be documenting all the nuances of `#backtrace_locations` setting, they are described in the [official documentation]((https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/exceptions_md.html#label-Backtraces)) exhaustively.
  * Note that `Thread::Backtrace::Location` objects can't be constructed from scratch, and only can be obtained from <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Kernel.html#method-i-caller_locations"><code>Kernel#caller_locations</code></a> or <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Exception.html#method-i-backtrace_locations"><code>Exception#backtrace_locations</code></a> of an existing error. In the case when you need to provide a completely "fake" backtrace which can't be obtained from the current stack (which in most cases is not a very good idea), you only can pass an array of strings to raise, but this sets only `#backtrace`:
    ```ruby
    begin
      raise RuntimeError, "Sneaky", %w[dsl.rb:1]
    rescue => ex
      p ex.backtrace           #=> ["dsl.rb:1"]
      p ex.backtrace_locations #=> nil
    end
    ```

#### Backtrace formatting adjustments[](#backtrace-formatting-adjustments)

1\) Backtick in the backtrace formatting was replaced with singular quote sign. 2) Module/class name was added to method names in backtace locations.

* **Reason:** Using backtick in the terminal rendering has a long tradition, but in the age of Markdown-like markups, it brings a lot of pain when copying error messages and call stacks into various input fields, so it was finally changed. Adding of the module owning the method is just a nice idea that doesn't require further explanations.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16495">Feature #16495</a> (backtick replacement), <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19117">Feature #19117</a> (class name)
* **Affected classes and methods:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Exception.html#method-i-backtrace"><code>Exception#backtrace</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Kernel.html#method-i-caller"><code>Kernel#caller</code></a> (return arrays of strings), <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Thread/Backtrace/Location.html"><code>Thread::Backtrace::Location</code></a> class (returned by <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Exception.html#method-i-backtrace_locations"><code>Exception#backtrace_locations</code></a> and <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Kernel.html#method-i-caller_locations"><code>Kernel#caller_locations</code></a>)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  class Calculator
    def divide(num, denom)
      num / denom
    end
  end

  c = Calculator.new
  c.divide(1, 0)
  # Ruby 3.3: backtick before the method name, no module names
  #   test.rb:3:in `/': divided by 0 (ZeroDivisionError)
  #     from test.rb:3:in `divide'
  #     from test.rb:8:in `<main>'
  # Ruby 3.4: method name wrapped in singular quotes, module names present
  #   test.rb:3:in 'Integer#/': divided by 0 (ZeroDivisionError)
  #     from test.rb:3:in 'Calculator#divide'
  #     from test.rb:8:in '<main>'

  # The module name is of that defining the method,
  # not the one that the method belonged to at the time of calling:
  module Multiplication
    def multiply(a, b) = a * b
  end

  class BetterCalculator < Calculator
    include Multiplication
  end

  c = BetterCalculator.new
  c.divide(1, 0)
  # test.rb:3:in 'Integer#/': divided by 0 (ZeroDivisionError)
  #   from test.rb:3:in 'Calculator#divide' -- not BetterCalculator#divide
  c.multiply(1, '2')
  # test.rb:8:in 'Integer#*': String can't be coerced into Integer (TypeError)
  #   from test.rb:8:in 'Multiplication#multiply' -- not BetterCaclulator#multiply

  # Unnamed classes/modules aren't mentioned in backtrace:
  c = Class.new do
    def foo = 1 / 0
  end

  o = c.new
  p o.method(:foo) #=> #<Method: #<Class:0x00007f6a2c698e88>#foo()...>
  o.foo
  # test.rb:2:in 'Integer#/': divided by 0 (ZeroDivisionError)
  #   from test.rb:2:in 'foo' -- #<Class:0x0...> is not included
  #   from test.rb:7:in '<main>'

  # #set_temporary_name doesn't affect backtrace either
  c.set_temporary_name('<Internal>')
  p o.method(:foo) #=> #<Method: <Internal>#foo()...> -- affects method representation
  o.foo
  # test.rb:2:in 'Integer#/': divided by 0 (ZeroDivisionError)
  #   from test.rb:2:in 'foo' -- still isn't included in backtrace
  #   from test.rb:11:in '<main>'
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * The changes might break some tests that expect particular error messages, but it was considered a reasonable risk.
  * Remember that all the methods defined on the top level are becoming private instance method of an `Object` class, and most of core "top-level" methods are actually methods of `Kernel` module, this makes some backtraces more explainable:
    ```ruby
    def my_method
      rand('test')
    end

    my_method
    # test.rb:2:in 'Kernel#rand': no implicit conversion of String into Integer (TypeError)
    #   from test.rb:2:in 'Object#my_method'
    #   from test.rb:5:in '<main>'
    ```
* **Follow-up:** In [4.0](4.0.html#argumenterror-backtrace-includes-receivers-classmodule-name), Module name was added to `ArgumentError` backtraced (which 3.4 missed).

#### Extra rescue/ensure frames are removed from the backtrace[](#extra-rescueensure-frames-are-removed-from-the-backtrace)

Before Ruby 3.4, there was an additional backtrace "frame" corresponding to the exception-handling block. It is removed for clarity.

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20275">Feature #20275</a>
* **Documentation:** —
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  begin
    1 / 0
  rescue
    raise "Something bad happened"
  end
  # Ruby 3.3:
  #   test.rb:4:in `rescue in <main>': Something bad happened (RuntimeError)
  #     from test.rb:1:in `<main>'  -- line where `begin` is
  # Ruby 3.4:

### `Warning.categories`[](#warningcategories)

Returns the list of all warning categories that can be set by <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Warning.html#method-c-5B-5D-3D"><code>Warning[]=</code></a> or running Ruby with `-W:<category name>`.

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20293">Feature #20293</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Warning.html#method-c-categories"><code>Warning.categories</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  Warning.categories
  # => [:deprecated, :experimental, :performance, :strict_unused_block]
  ```

### `GC.config`[](#gcconfig)

A new method that returns two values so far, and allows to set one of them: `:rgengc_allow_full_mark`—whether major GC cycle is disabled.

* **Reason:** The goal of the discussion that led to the `GC.config` introduction, was focused on an ability to disable "major" garbage collection, which might reclaim more memory, yet also might introduce significant slow-down.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20443">Feature #20443</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/GC.html#method-c-config"><code>GC.config</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  GC.config
  #=> {rgengc_allow_full_mark: true, implementation: "default"}
  GC.config(rgengc_allow_full_mark: false)
  #=> {rgengc_allow_full_mark: false}
  GC.config
  #=> {rgengc_allow_full_mark: false, implementation: "default"}

  # Unknown keys are ignored:
  GC.config(threads: 1)
  #=> {rgengc_allow_full_mark: false}

  # Attempt to set implementation: raises:
  GC.config(implementation: 'alternative')
  # in 'GC.config': Attempting to set read-only key "Implementation" (ArgumentError)
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * The second key present in the config is related to the current garbage collector implementation, see [Implemention changes](#cruby-implementation-changes) section. It raises on attempt to be set.
  * While discussing possible API for disabling the major GC, many options was considered (like `GC.disable_major` or `GC.disable(major: true)`), but eventually generic and extensible pair of getter and setter `.config`/`.config(value)` was agreed upon.
  * See [this Jemma Isroff's article](https://jemma.dev/blog/gc-generational) for a deep explanation about major/minor GC.

### `Fiber::Scheduler#blocking_operation_wait`[](#fiberschedulerblocking_operation_wait)

Implements a generic API to offload CPU-bound blocking operation into a separate thread by Fiber scheduler.

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20876">Feature #20876</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Fiber/Scheduler.html#method-i-blocking_operation_wait"><code>Fiber::Scheduler#blocking_operation_wait</code></a>
* **Notes:**
  * See code examples in [3.0 changelog](3.0.html#non-blocking-fiber-and-scheduler) for general demo of using Fiber Scheduler. As no simple implementation is available, it is complicated to show an example of new hooks in play.
  * Just to remind: Ruby does not include the default implementation of Fiber Scheduler, but the maintainer of the feature, Samuel Williams, provides one in his gem <a class="github" href="https://github.com/socketry/async">Async</a> which is Ruby 3.4-compatible already.

### `Ractor`[](#ractor)

#### `require` works in Ractors[](#require-works-in-ractors)

`require` now works in non-main Ractors. It delegates requiring to the main ractor and blocks while waiting for it.

* **Reason:** not being able to invoke `require` from Ractor was one of a major usability problem, as it meant that no library can be safely used from them: many libraries `require` additional code during some calls. Even Ruby core does this: say, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Kernel.html#method-i-pp"><code>Kernel#pp</code></a> internally requires `pp` library on the first call.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20876">Feature #20876</a>
* **Documentation:** — (no new public methods added, `require` just works as usual in Ractors)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  r = Ractor.new { require 'json' }
  r.take
  # Ruby 3.3: `require': can not access non-shareable objects in constant Kernel::RUBYGEMS_ACTIVATION_MONITOR by non-main ractor. (Ractor::IsolationError)
  # Ruby 3.4: successfully required

  r = Ractor.new { pp ["test"] }
  # Ruby 3.3: Ractor::IsolationError -- `pp` call implicitly does `require "pp"` on the first call
  # Ruby 3.4: prints ["test"]
  ```
* **Notes:** The technical implementation of the availability of `require` can be seen in <a class="github" href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/v3_4_0/ractor.rb#L905-L916">ractor.rb</a>: on the creation of the first Ractor in the program, an anonymous module prepended to `Kernel`, that wraps an existing `require` definition into one that considers Ractors. It can be inspected in user code like this:
  ```ruby
  p Kernel.instance_method(:require)
  #=> #<UnboundMethod: Kernel#require(path) <internal:.../rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb>:36>

  Ractor.new { }

  p Kernel.instance_method(:require) # the implementation is updated
  #=> #<UnboundMethod: <RactorRequire>#require(feature) <internal:ractor>:908>
  ```

#### `.main?`[](#main)

"Main" Ractor (where the initial program runs) is an important concept, as it is the one which has more possibilities than non-main ones, like setting instance variables of classes/modules. Now this concept is exposed to the user code.

* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Ractor.html#method-c-main-3F"><code>Ractor.main?</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  p Ractor.main? # prints true
  Ractor.new { p Ractor.main? }.take # prints false

  # Potential usage:
  class Configuration
    class << self
      attr_accessor :enabled
    end
  end

  def naive_flip
    Configuration.enabled = !Configuration.enabled
  end

  def ractor_aware_flip
    if Ractor.main?
      Configuration.enabled = !Configuration.enabled
    else
      warn "Can't be flipped from non-main Ractor"
      # ...or delegate it to a main ractor
    end
  end

  naive_flip # works
  Ractor.new { naive_flip }.take
  # 'Object#naive_flip': can not set instance variables of classes/modules by non-main Ractors (Ractor::IsolationError)
  Ractor.new { ractor_aware_flip }.take

  ```

#### `.[]` and `.[]=`[](#and-)

A pair of methods provides a Ractor-local storage, akin to <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Fiber.html#method-c-5B-5D"><code>Fiber.[]</code></a> and <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Fiber.html#method-c-5B-5D-3D"><code>.[]=</code></a>.

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20715">Feature #20715</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Ractor.html#method-c-5B-5D"><code>Ractor.[]</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Ractor.html#method-c-5B-5D-3D"><code>Ractor.[]=</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  p Ractor[:value] #=> nil
  Ractor[:value] = 10
  p Ractor[:value] #=> 10

  Ractor.new {
    p Ractor[:value] #=> nil -- the value store is per-ractor
    Ractor[:value] = 15
    p Ractor[:value] #=> 15
  }.take
  p Ractor[:value] #=> 10

  # Strings and symbols are supported, being treated as the same key:
  Ractor['value'] #=> 10
  # Any value that responds to #to_str explicit conversion method is supported:
  o = Object.new
  def o.to_str = 'value'
  Ractor[o] #=> 10

  # Other values aren't supported:
  Ractor[1]
  # in 'Ractor.[]': 1 is not a symbol nor a string (TypeError)
  ```
* **Notes:** Like Fiber's methods, and unlike <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Thread.html#method-i-5B-5D"><code>Thread#[]</code></a> and <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Thread.html#method-i-5B-5D-3D"><code>#[]=</code></a>, you only can access to the current Ractor's storage.

#### `.store_if_absent`[](#store_if_absent)

In addition to the above method that were introduced for Ractor-local storage, the method `store_if_absent(name) { block }` was introduced to initialize the value in an atomic thread-safe way.

* **Reason:** As Ractors are a concurrency primitive, there is a high chance of using them together with other concurrency primitives, like threads. In this case, `[]` and `[]=` aren't enough to safely initialize value, as `Ractor[key] ||= some_value` is actually two operations (fetch existing value, see if it is `nil`, store a new value), which can be problematic when several threads do this concurrently.

* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Ractor.html#method-c-store_if_absent"><code>Ractor.store_if_absent</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  def calculate
    puts "calculating in #{Ractor.current}"
    rand(10)
  end

  r1 = Ractor.new {
    3.times.map { Ractor.store_if_absent(:value) { calculate } }
  }

  r2 = Ractor.new {
    5.times.map { Ractor.store_if_absent(:value) { calculate } }
  }

  p r1.take
  p r2.take
  # This prints (numbers might differ obviously, but always the same in one ractor):
  #
  # calculating in #<Ractor:#2 test.rb:6 running>
  # calculating in #<Ractor:#3 test.rb:10 running>
  # [2, 2, 2]
  # [6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
  ```

### `RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree::Node#locations`[](#rubyvmabstractsyntaxtreenodelocations)

For some nodes of AbstractSyntaxTree, several locations are returned, corresponding to various parts of the node.

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20624">Feature #20624</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/RubyVM/AbstractSyntaxTree/Node.html#method-i-locations"><code>RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree::Node#locations</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/RubyVM/AbstractSyntaxTree/Location.html"><code>RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree::Location</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  root = RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree.parse("a || b")
  root # top-level node is "scope"
  #=> (SCOPE@1:0-1:6 tbl: [] args: nil body: (OR@1:0-1:6 (VCALL@1:0-1:1 :a) (VCALL@1:5-1:6 :b)))

  or_op = root.children[2] # its second child is OR node
  # => (OR@1:0-1:6 (VCALL@1:0-1:1 :a) (VCALL@1:5-1:6 :b))
  or_op.locations
  # => [#<RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree::Location:@1:0-1:6>, #<RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree::Location:@1:2-1:4>]
  #
  # a || b
  #   ^^ -- second location (positions 2-4)
  # ^^^^^^ -- first location (positions 0-6, the whole node)

  # For other nodes, only one location, corresponding to the whole node, is returned:
  RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree.parse("a + b").children[2].locations
  # => [#<RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree::Location:@1:0-1:5>]
  ```
* **Notes:** TBH, the choice of which nodes provide additional locations, and to which parts of them, seem kinda arbitrary for me (changelog's [author](https://zverok.space/)). In the example above, it might be argued that in `a + b` case `+` has its separate node (unlike `a || b`), but this node is still represented by just a Symbol and doesn't provide location information anyway. Which nodes are handled separately can be seen in the [C code](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/v3_4_0/ast.c#L777-L871). On the other hand, with Prism becoming the default parser, `RubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree` kinda loses its importance: using `Prism.parse('code')` provides much more detailed and well-represented information.

## Standard library[](#standard-library)

Since Ruby 3.1 release, most of the standard library is extracted to either _default_ or _bundled_ gems; their development happens in separate repositories, and changelogs are either maintained there, or absent altogether. Either way, their changes aren't mentioned in the combined Ruby changelog, and I'll not be trying to follow all of them.

> **[stdgems.org](https://stdgems.org/)** project has a nice explanations of default and bundled gems concepts, as well as a list of currently gemified libraries and links to their docs.

> "For the rest of us" this means libraries development extracted into separate GitHub repositories, and they are just packaged with main Ruby before release. It means you can do issue/PR to any of them independently, without going through more tough development process of the core Ruby.

A few changes to mention, though:

* <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Socket/ResolutionError.html"><code>Socket::ResolutionError</code></a> is added and raised on unsuccessful name resolution instead of generic `SocketError`. Discussion: <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20018">Feature #20018</a>.
* <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Timeout.html#method-c-timeout"><code>Timeout.timeout</code></a> fails on negative values. Discussion: <a class="tracker bug" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20795">Bug #20795</a>
* <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/Tempfile.html#method-c-create"><code>Tempfile.create</code></a>: allows to pass keyword argument `anonymous: true`, which opens an immediately removed temporary file: this file still can be used by the code that needs an IO object, but there is no need to remove it after usage. Discussion: <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20497">Feature #20497</a>

### Version updates[](#version-updates)

_See the **[corresponding section](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/v3_4_0/NEWS.md#stdlib-updates) in the official NEWS-file**. This year, it provides full information, including links to change descriptions, which I see no reason to just copy here._

### Standard library content changes[](#standard-library-content-changes)

* <a class="github" href="https://github.com/ruby/repl_type_completor">repl_type_completor</a> is added as a bundled gem.

#### Default gems that became bundled[](#default-gems-that-became-bundled)

_This means that if your dependencies are managed by Bundler and your code depend on one of them, they should now be added to a `Gemfile`._

## CRuby Implementation changes[](#cruby-implementation-changes)

* <a class="github" href="https://github.com/ruby/prism">Prism</a>, which was [introduced](3.3.html#new-libraries) as alternative parser in Ruby 3.3, became the default one. The classic parser still can be used via `--parser=parse.y` command-line argument. Discussion: <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20564">Feature #20564</a>.
* Garbage collector became modular, and alternative GC implementations can be loaded. Discussions: <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20470">Feature #20470</a>, <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20351">Feature #20351</a>.
* Redefining some core methods that are specially optimized by the interpreter and JIT like `String#freeze` or `Integer#+` now emits a warning of `:performance` category:
  ```ruby
  Warning[:performance] = true # or -W:performance when running ruby
  class Integer
    def +(other)
      # some alternative implementation, maybe supporting custom classes
    end
  end
  # test.rb:4: warning: Redefining 'Integer#+' disables interpreter and JIT optimizations
  ```
  Discussion: <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20429">Feature #20429</a>
* `Integer#**` and `Rational#**` used to return `Float::INFINITY` or `Float::NAN` when the numerator of the return value is large, but now returns an Integer. If the return value is extremely large, it raises an exception. Discussion: <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/20811">Feature #20811</a>
