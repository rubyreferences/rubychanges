# Ruby 3.0

* **Released at:** Dec 25, 2020 (<a class="github" href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/ruby_3_0/NEWS.md">NEWS.md</a> file)
* **Status (as of Feb 04, 2023):** 3.0.5 is current _stable_
* **This document first published:** Dec 25, 2020
* **Last change to this document:** Feb 04, 2023

## Highlights[](#highlights)

Ruby 3.0 is a major language release. The core team worked hard to preserve backward compatibility while delivering some huge and exciting new features.

* [Full separation of keyword arguments](#keyword-arguments-are-now-fully-separated-from-positional-arguments)
* [Ractors](#ractors): Thread-alike object implementing the actor model, and finally lifting the GVL (Global Virtual machine Lock) and enabling true concurrency
* [Non-blocking IO with Fibers](#non-blocking-fiber-and-scheduler)
* [Type declarations](#types) (in separate files)
* Pattern matching:
  * [No longer experimental](#pattern-matching)
  * Two flavors for one-line pattern matching: [`=>` (aka rightward assignment)](#one-line-pattern-matching-with-) and [`in` (aka boolean check)](#in-as-a-truefalse-check)
  * [Find patterns](#find-pattern)
* ["Endless" methods](#endless-method-definition)
* [GC auto-compaction](#gcauto_compact-accessor)

## Language changes[](#language-changes)

### Keyword arguments are now fully separated from positional arguments[](#keyword-arguments-are-now-fully-separated-from-positional-arguments)

The separation which [started in 2.7](2.7.html#keyword-argument-related-changes) with deprecations, is now fully finished. It means  keyword arguments are not a "syntax sugar" on top of hashes, and they never converted into each other implicitly:

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14183">Feature #14183</a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  def old_style(name, options = {})
  end

  def new_style(name, **options)
  end

  new_style('John', {age: 10})
  # Ruby 2.6: works
  # Ruby 2.7: warns: Using the last argument as keyword parameters is deprecated; maybe ** should be added to the call
  # Ruby 3.0: ArgumentError (wrong number of arguments (given 2, expected 1))
  new_style('John', age: 10)
  # => works
  h = {age: 10}
  new_style('John', **h)
  # => works, ** is mandatory

  # The last hash argument still allowed to be passed without {}:
  old_style('John', age: 10)
  # => works
  ```
* **Notes:** There is a [big and detailed explanation](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2019/12/12/separation-of-positional-and-keyword-arguments-in-ruby-3-0/) of the separation reasons, logic, and edge cases on Ruby site, written at the dawn of 2.7, so we will not go into more details here.

#### Procs with "rest" arguments and keywords: change of autosplatting behavior[](#procs-with-rest-arguments-and-keywords-change-of-autosplatting-behavior)

Just a leftover from the separation of keyword arguments.

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16166">Feature #16166</a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  block = proc { |*args, **kwargs| puts "args=#{args}, kwargs=#{kwargs}"}
  block.call(1, 2, a: true)
  # Ruby 2.7: args=[1, 2], kwargs={:a=>true} -- as expected
  # Ruby 3.0: args=[1, 2], kwargs={:a=>true} -- same
  block.call(1, 2, {a: true})
  # Ruby 2.7:
  #  warning: Using the last argument as keyword parameters is deprecated
  #  args=[1, 2], kwargs={:a=>true} -- but extracted to keyword args nevertheless
  # Ruby 3.0:
  #  args=[1, 2, {:a=>true}], kwargs={} -- no attempt to extract hash into keywords, and no error/warning
  ```
* **Follow-up:** In Ruby 3.2, one more proc argument splatting behavior [was improved](3.2.html#keyword-argument-separation-leftovers).

### Arguments forwarding (`...`) supports leading arguments[](#arguments-forwarding--supports-leading-arguments)

* **Reason:** Argument forwarding, when [introduced in 2.7](2.7.html#keyword-argument-related-changes), was able to forward only all-or-nothing. It turned out to be not enough. One of the important usages for leading arguments are cases like `method_missing` and other DSL-defined methods that need to pass to the nested method `:some_symbol` + all of the original arguments.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16378">Feature #16378</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/syntax/methods_rdoc.html#label-Argument+forwarding"><code>doc/syntax/methods.rdoc</code></a> _<small>(the link is to a `master` version, docs were merged post 3.0 release)</small>_
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  def request(method, url, headers: {})
    puts "#{method.upcase} #{url} (headers=#{headers})"
  end

  def get(...)
    request(:get, ...)
  end

  get('https://example.com', headers: {content_type: 'json'})
  # GET https://example.com (headers={:content_type=>"json"})

  # Leading arguments may be present both in the call and in the definition:
  def logged_get(message, ...)
    puts message
    get(...)
  end

  logged_get('Logging', 'https://example.com', headers: {content_type: 'json'})
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * "all arguments splat" `...` should be the last statement in the argument list (both on a declaration and a call)
  * on a method declaration, arguments before `...` can only be positional (not keyword) arguments, and can't have default values (it would be `SyntaxError`);
  * on a method call, arguments passed before `...` can't be keyword arguments (it would be `SyntaxError`);
  * make sure to check your punctuation thoroughly, because `anything ...` is a syntax for endless range, those constructs are valid syntax, but would do not what is expected:
    ```ruby
    def delegates(...)
      # call without "()" -- actually parsed as (p()...)
      p ...
      # Prints nothing, but warns: warning: ... at EOL, should be parenthesized?

      # "," accidentally missing after 1, there is just one argument: 1...
      p(1 ...)
      # Prints "1..."

      p(1, ...)
      # Prints, as expected:
      #   1
      #   5
    end

    delegates(5)
    ```
* **Follow-ups:**
  * In Ruby 3.1, a separate anonymous block argument (bare `&`) forwarding [was added](3.1.html#anonymous-block-argument);
  * In Ruby 3.2, separate positional and keyword (bare `*` and `**`) forwarding [were added](3.2.html#anonymous-arguments-passing-improvements).

### "Endless" method definition[](#endless-method-definition)

Methods of exactly one statement now can be defined with syntax `def method() = statement`. (The syntax doesn't need `end`, hence the "endless definition" moniker.)

* **Reason:** Ruby's `end`s (unlike C-like languages' `{}`) are generally OK for Rubyists, but make small utility methods look more heavy than they should. For small utility methods with body containing just one short statement like:
  ```ruby
  def available?
    !@internal.empty?
  end
  ```
  ...the "proper" definition might look so heavy that one will decide against it to leave the class more readable (and instead make class' clients to just do `obj.internal.empty?` themselves, making it less semantical). For such cases, a shortcut one-line definition may change the perceiving of utility method creation:
  ```ruby
  def available? = !@internal.any?
  def finished? = available? && @internal.all?(&:finished?)
  def clear = @internal.clear
  ```

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16746">Feature #16746</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/syntax/methods_rdoc.html"><code>doc/syntax/methods.rdoc</code></a> _<small>(the link is to a `master` version, docs were merged post 3.0 release)</small>_
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  def dbg = puts("DBG: #{caller.first}")

  dbg
  # Prints: DBG: test.rb:3:in `<main>'

  # The method definition supports all kinds of arguments:
  def dbg_args(a, b=1, c:, d: 6, &block) = puts("Args passed: #{[a, b, c, d, block.call]}")
  dbg_args(0, c: 5) { 7 }
  # Prints: Args passed: [0, 1, 5, 6, 7]

  # For argument definition, () is mandatory
  def square x = x**2
  # syntax error, unexpected end-of-input -- because Ruby treats it as
  #   def square(x = x**2)
  # ...e.g. an argument with default value, referencing itself, and no method body

  # This works
  def square(x) = x**2
  square(100) # => 10000

  # To avoid confusion, defining method names like #foo= is prohibited
  class A
    # SyntaxError "setter method cannot be defined in an endless method definition":
    def attr=(val) = @attr = val

    # Other suffixes are OK:
    def attr?() = !!@attr
    def attr!() = @attr = true
  end

  # funnily enough, operator methods are OK, including #==
  class A
    def ==(other) = true
  end

  p A.new == 5 # => true

  # any singular expression can be method body

  # This works:
  def read(name) = File.read(name)
                       .split("\n")
                       .map(&:strip)
                       .reject(&:empty?)
                       .uniq
                       .sort

  # Or even this, though, what's the point?..
  def weird(name) = begin
                      data = File.read(name)
                      process(data)
                      true
                    rescue
                      false
                    end

  # inside method body, method calls without parentheses cause a syntax error:
  def foo() = puts "bar"
  #                ^ syntax error, unexpected string literal, expecting `do' or '{' or '('

  # This is due to parsing ambiguity and is aligned with some other places, like
  x = 1 + sin y
  #           ^ syntax error, unexpected tIDENTIFIER, expecting keyword_do or '{' or '('
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * The initial proposal seems to be a good-natured April Fool's joke, then everybody suddenly liked it, and, with a slight change of syntax, it was accepted;
  * Feature is marked as EXPERIMENTAL, but it does NOT produce a warning, it is deliberate, see discussion in <a class="tracker misc" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17399">Misc #17399</a>.
* **Follow-up:** In Ruby 3.1, the requirement to wrap method calls in parenthesis inside endless method body [was removed](3.1.html#inside-endless-method-definitions-method-calls-without-parenthesis-are-allowed).

### Pattern matching[](#pattern-matching)

**Pattern matching, [introduced in 2.7](2.7.html#pattern-matching), is no longer experimental.** Discussion: <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17260">Feature #17260</a>.

#### One-line pattern matching with `=>`[](#one-line-pattern-matching-with-)

* **Reason:** This is an interesting one. Two facts were discussed between 2.7 and 3.0: the fact that in most of the other languages one-line pattern matching has a different order (`<pattern> <operator> <data>`) than introduced in Ruby 2.7 (`<data> in <pattern>`); and the idea of "rightward assignment operator" `=>` for more natural chaining. And then, at some point, ideas converged most fruitfully.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17260">Feature #17260</a>  (main pattern matching tracking ticket), <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16670">Feature #16670</a>  (reverse order), <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15921">Feature #15921</a>  (standalone rightward assignment operator), <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15799">Feature #15799</a>  (abandoned "pipeline operator" idea, in discussion of which "rightward assignment" was born)
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/syntax/pattern_matching_rdoc.html"><code>doc/syntax/pattern_matching.rdoc</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  # match and unpack:
  {db: {user: 'John', role: 'admin'}} => {db: {user:, role:}}
  p [user, role] # => ["John", "admin"]

  # pattern-matching as a rightward assignment for long experessions:
  File.read('test.txt')
      .split("\n")
      .map(&:strip)
      .reject(&:empty?)
      .first(10) => lines

  p lines # first 10 non-empty lines of the file

  # unpacking+assignment is extremely powerful:
  (1..10).to_a.shuffle => [*before, (2..4) => threshold, *after]
  # ...in input sequence, find first entry in range 2..4, put it into `threshold`,
  # and split parts of the sequence before/after it
  p [before, threshold, after]    # your results might be different due to shuffle :)
  # => [[7, 5, 8], 3, [1, 10, 6, 9, 4, 2]]

  # The things can get really out of hand quickly:
  Time.now.hour => ..9 | 18.. => non_working_hour
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * Feature is marked as EXPERIMENTAL, will warn so on an attempt of usage, and may change in the future;
  * But simple assignment usage (`data => variable`) is **not** considered experimental and is here to stay;
  * One quirk that might be non-obvious: pattern matching can desconstruct-assign only to local variables, so when using `=>` as an assignment operator, you will see those are syntax errors:
    ```ruby
    some_statement => @x
    some_statement => obj.attr # meaning to call `obj.attr=`
    some_statement => $y # ...though maybe don't use global variables :)
    ```
* **Follow-ups:**
  * As of 3.1, the feature is no longer experimental;
  * In 3.1, the parenthesis around the pattern [became optional](3.1.html#parentheses-can-be-omitted-in-one-line-pattern-matching).

#### `in` as a `true`/`false` check[](#in-as-a-truefalse-check)

After the change described above, `in` was reintroduced to return `true`/`false` (whether the pattern matches) instead of raising `NoMatchingPatternError`.

* **Reason:** The new meaning allows pattern matching to be more tightly integrated with other constructs in the control flow, like iteration and regular conditions.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17371">Feature #17371</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/syntax/pattern_matching_rdoc.html"><code>doc/syntax/pattern_matching.rdoc</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  user = {role: 'admin', login: 'matz'}
  if user in {role: 'admin', login:}
    puts "Granting admin scope: #{login}"
  end
  # otherwise just proceed with regular scope, no need to raise

  users = [
    {name: 'John', role: 'user'},
    {name: 'Jane', registered_at: Time.new(2017, 5, 8) },
    {name: 'Barb', role: 'admin'},
    {name: 'Dave', role: 'user'}
  ]
  old_users_range = Time.new(2016)..Time.new(2019)
  # Choose for some notification only admins and old users
  users.select { |u| u in {role: 'admin'} | {registered_at: ^old_users_range} }
  #=> [{:name=>"Jane", :registered_at=>2017-05-08 00:00:00 +0300}, {:name=>"Barb", :role=>"admin"}]
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * Feature is marked as EXPERIMENTAL, will warn so on an attempt of usage, and may change in the future.
* **Follow-ups:**
  * As of 3.1, the feature is no longer experimental;
  * In 3.1, the parenthesis around the pattern [became optional](3.1.html#parentheses-can-be-omitted-in-one-line-pattern-matching).

#### Find pattern[](#find-pattern)

Pattern matching now supports "find patterns", with several splats in them.

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16828">Feature #16828</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/syntax/pattern_matching_rdoc.html"><code>doc/syntax/pattern_matching.rdoc</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  users = [
    {name: 'John', role: 'user'},
    {name: 'Jane', role: 'manager'},
    {name: 'Barb', role: 'admin'},
    {name: 'Dave', role: 'manager'}
  ]

  # Now, how do you find admin with just pattern matching?..

  # Ruby 3.0:
  case users
  in [*, {name:, role: 'admin'}, *] # Note the pattern: find something in the middle, with unknown number of items before/after
    puts "Admin: #{name}"
  end
  # => Admin: Barb

  # Without any limitations to choose the value, the first splat is non-greedy:
  case users
  in [*before, user, *after]
    puts "Before match: #{before}"
    puts "Match: #{user}"
    puts "After match: #{after}"
  end
  # Before match: []
  # Match: {:name=>"John", :role=>"user"}
  # After match: [{:name=>"Jane", :role=>"manager"}, {:name=>"Barb", :role=>"admin"}, {:name=>"Dave", :role=>"manager"}]

  # Guard clause does not considered when choosing where to splat:
  case users
  in [*, user, *] if user[:role] == 'admin'
    puts "User: #{user}"
  end
  # => NoMatchingPatternError -- it first put John into `user`,
  # and only then checked the guard clause, which is not matching

  # If the "find pattern" is used (there is more than one splat in the pattern),
  # there should be exactly TWO of them, and they may ONLY be the very first and
  # the very last element:
  case users
  in [first_user, *, {name:, role: 'admin'}, *]
    #                                        ^  syntax error, unexpected *
    puts "Admin: #{name}"
  end

  # Singular splat is still allowe in any place:
  case users
  in [{name: first_user_name}, *, {name: last_user_name}]
    puts "First user: #{first_user_name}, last user: #{last_user_name}"
  end
  # => First user: John, last user: Dave
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * Feature is marked as EXPERIMENTAL, will warn so on an attempt of usage, and may change in the future.
* **Follow-ups:** Feature considered not experimental since 3.2

### Changes in class variable behavior[](#changes-in-class-variable-behavior)

When class `@@variable` is overwritten by the parent of the class, or by the module included, the error is raised. In addition, top-level class variable access also raises an error.

* **Reason:** Class variables, with their "non-intuitive" access rules, are frequently considered a bad practice. They still can be very useful for tracking something across class hierarchy. But the fact that the entire hierarchy shares the same variable may lead to hard-to-debug bugs, so it was fixed to raise on the usage that seems unintentional.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker bug" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14541">Bug #14541</a>
* **Documentation:** —
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  # Intended usage: parent defines the variable available for all children
  class Good
    @@registry = [] # assume it is meant to store all the children

    def self.registry
      @@registry
    end
  end

  class GoodChild < Good
    def self.register!
      @@registry << self
      @@registry = @@registry.sort # reassigning the value -- but it is still the PARENT's variable
    end
  end

  GoodChild.register!
  p Good.registry # => [GoodChild]

  # Unintended usage: the variable is defined in the child, but then the parent changes it
  class Bad
    def self.corrupt_registry!
      @@registry = []
    end
  end

  class BadChild < Bad
    @@registry = {} # This is some variable which meant to belong to THIS class

    def self.registry
      @@registry
    end
  end

  Bad.corrupt_registry! # Probably unexpected for BadChild's author, its ancestor have changed the variable
  BadChild.registry     # On the next attempt to _access_ the variable the error will be raised
  # 2.7: => []
  # 3.0: RuntimeError (class variable @@registry of BadChild is overtaken by Bad)

  # The same error is raised if the included module suddenly changes class
  module OtherRegistry
    @@registry = {}
  end

  Good.include OtherRegistry
  Good.registry      # On the next attempt to _access_ the variable the error will be raised
  # 2.7: => {}
  # 3.0: RuntimeError (class variable @@registry of Good is overtaken by OtherRegistry)
  ```

### Other changes[](#other-changes)

* Global variables that lost their special meaning, just a regular globals now:
  * `$SAFE` (the global setting related to tainting, [deprecated in 2.7](2.7.html#safe-and-taint-concepts-are-deprecated-in-general)) -- <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16131">Feature #16131</a>
  * `$KCODE` (legacy encoding setting) -- <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17136">Feature #17136</a>
* `yield` in a singleton class definitions, which was deprecated in [2.7](2.7.html#warningsdeprecations) is now `SyntaxError` -- <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15575">Feature #15575</a>
* Assigning to a numbered parameter ([introduced in 2.7](2.7.html#numbered-block-parameters)) is now a `SyntaxError` instead of a warning.

## Types[](#types)

The discussion of possible solutions for _static_ or _gradual_ typing and possible syntax of type declarations in Ruby code had been open for years. At 3.0, Ruby's core team made their mind towards **type declaration in separate files** and **separate tools to check types**. So, as of 3.0:

* **type declarations** for Ruby code should be defined **in separate files** with extension `*.rbs`
* **the syntax for type declarations** is like following (small example):
  ```ruby
  class Dog
    attr_reader name: String

    def initialize: (name: String) -> void

    def bark: (at: Person | Dog | nil) -> String
  end
  ```
* **type declaration for the core classes and the standard library** is shipped with the language;
* **<a class="github" href="https://github.com/ruby/rbs">rbs</a> library is shipped with Ruby**, providing tools for checking actual types in code against the declarations; and for auto-detecting (to some extent) the actual types of yet-untyped code;
* **<a class="github" href="https://github.com/ruby/typeprof">TypeProf</a>** is another tool ("Type Profiler") shipping with Ruby 3.0 as a bundled gem, allowing **to auto-detect the actual types** of the Ruby by "abstract interpretation" (running through code without actually executing it);

> For a deeper understanding, please check those tools' documentation; also [this article](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/climbing-steep-hills-or-adopting-ruby-types) by Vladimir Dementiev of Evil Martians takes a detailed look into tools and concepts.

## Core classes and modules[](#core-classes-and-modules)

### `Object#clone(freeze: true)`[](#objectclonefreeze-true)

`freeze:` argument now works both ways (previously only `freeze: false` had an effect).

* **Reason:** Mostly for consistency. `Object#clone(freeze: false)` was [introduced in Ruby 2.4](2.4.html#objectclonefreeze-false) as an _only_ way of producing unfrozen object; `clone(freeze: true)` is basically an equivalent of `clone` + `freeze`.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16175">Feature #16175</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Kernel.html#method-i-clone"><code>Kernel#clone</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  o = Object.new
  o.clone(freeze: true).frozen?
  # => false in Ruby 2.7
  # => true in Ruby 3.0

  o = Object.new.freeze
  o.clone(freeze: false).frozen?
  # => false in Ruby 2.7 and 3.0
  ```

### `Object#clone` passes `freeze:` argument to `#initialize_clone`[](#objectclone-passes-freeze-argument-to-initialize_clone)

Specialized constructor `#initialize_clone`, which is called when object is cloned, now receives `freeze:` argument if it was passed to `#clone`.

* **Reason:** For composite objects, it is hard to address freezing/unfreezing of nested data in `#initialize_clone` without this argument.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker bug" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14266">Bug #14266</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Kernel.html#method-i-clone"><code>Kernel#clone</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  require 'set'
  set = Set[1, 2, 3].freeze
  set.frozen? # => true
  set.instance_variable_get('@hash').frozen? # => true, as expected

  unfrozen = set.clone(freeze: false)
  unfrozen.frozen? # => false, as expected
  unfrozen.instance_variable_get('@hash').frozen?
  # 2.7: => true, still
  # 3.0: => false, as it should be -- becase Set have redefined #initialize_clone

  unfrozen << 4
  # 2.7: FrozenError (can't modify frozen Hash: {1=>true, 2=>true, 3=>true})
  # 3.0: => #<Set: {1, 2, 3, 4}>
  ```
* **Notes:** A lot of attention to proper object freezing in Ruby 3.0 is due to the introduction of [Ractors](#ractors), which made the important distinction if the object is truly frozen (and therefore safe to share between parallel ractors).

### `Kernel#eval` changed processing of `__FILE__` and `__LINE__`[](#kerneleval-changed-processing-of-__file__-and-__line__)

Now, when the second argument (`binding`) is passed to `eval`, `__FILE__` in evaluated code is `(eval)`, and `__LINE__` starts from `1` (just like without `binding`). Before 2.7 it was evaluated in context of `binding` (e.g. returned file from where `binding` came from), on 2.7 the warning was printed; now the behavior is considered final.

* **Reason:** Binding might be passed to `eval` in order to provide the access to some context necessary for evaluation (this technique, for example, frequently used in templating engines); but it had an unintended consequence of making `__FILE__` and `__LINE__` to point not to actually evaluated code, which can be misleading, for example, on errors processing.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker bug" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/4352">Bug #4352</a>
* **Affected methods:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Kernel.html#method-i-eval"><code>Kernel#eval</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Binding.html#method-i-eval"><code>Binding#eval</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  # file a.rb
  class A
    def get_binding
      binding
    end
  end

  # file b.rb
  require_relative 'a'
  eval('p [__FILE__, __LINE__]')                    # without binding
  eval('p [__FILE__, __LINE__]', A.new.get_binding) # with binding from another file
  # Ruby 2.6:
  #  ["(eval)", 1]
  #  ["a.rb", 3]

  # Ruby 2.7:
  #  ["(eval)", 1]
  #  ["a.rb", 3]
  #   warning: __FILE__ in eval may not return location in binding; use Binding#source_location instead
  #   warning: __LINE__ in eval may not return location in binding; use Binding#source_location instead

  # Ruby 3.0:
  #  ["(eval)", 1]
  #  ["(eval)", 1]
  ```

### `Regexp` and `Range` objects are frozen[](#regexp-and-range-objects-are-frozen)

* **Reason:** The change is related to Ractor introduction (see below): it makes a difference whether an object is frozen when sharing it between ractors. As both ranges and regexps have immutable core data, it was considered that making them frozen is the right thing to do.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/8948">Feature #8948</a>, <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16377">Feature #16377</a>, <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15504">Feature #15504</a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  /foo/.frozen?   # => true
  (42...).frozen? # => true

  # Regexps are frozen even when constructed with dynamic interpolation
  /.#{rand(10)}/.frozen? # => true

  # ...but not when they are constructed with the constructor
  Regexp.new('foo').frozen?  # => false

  # ...but ranges are always frozen
  Range.new('a', 'b').frozen? # => true

  # Regularly, as the data can't be changed anyways, the frozenness wouldn't affect your code.
  # It might, though, if the code does something smart like:
  regexp = /^\w+\s*\w*$/
  regexp.instance_variable_set('@context', :name)
  # 2.7: ok
  # 3.0: FrozenError (can't modify frozen Regexp: /^\w+\s*\w*$/)

  # ...or
  RANGE = Time.new(2020, 3, 1)..Time.new(2020, 9, 1)
  def RANGE.to_s
    self.begin.strftime('%Y, %b %d') + ' - ' + self.end.strftime('%b %d')
  end
  # 2.7: OK
  # 3.0: FrozenError (can't modify frozen object: 2020-03-01 00:00:00 +0200..2020-09-01 00:00:00 +0300)

  # Note also, that range freezing is not "deep":
  string_range = 'a'..'z'
  string_range.end.upcase!
  string_range
  # => 'a'..'Z'

  # clone(freeze: false) still allows to unfreeze both:
  unfrozen = RANGE.clone(freeze: false)
  def unfrozen.to_s
    self.begin.strftime('%Y, %b %d') + ' - ' + self.end.strftime('%b %d')
  end
  puts unfrozen
  # Prints: "2020, Mar 01 - Sep 01"
  ```
* **Notes:** The fact that dynamically created ranges are frozen and regexps are not, is explained this way: Ideally, both should be frozen, yet there are some gems (and some core Ruby tests) that use dynamic singleton method definitions on regexps, and it was decided that incompatibility should be avoided.

### `Module`[](#module)

#### `#include` and `#prepend` now affects modules including the receiver[](#include-and-prepend-now-affects-modules-including-the-receiver)

If class `C` includes module `M`, and after that we did `M.include M1`, before Ruby 3.0, `M1` would not have been included into `C`; and now it is.

* **Reason:** The behavior was long-standing and led to a lot of confusion (especially considering that including something in the class _did_ affected its descendants).
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/9573">Feature #9573</a>
* **Documentation:** —
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  module MyEnumerableExtension
    def each2(&block)
      each_slice(2, &block)
    end
  end

  Enumerable.include MyEnumerableExtension

  (1..8).each2.to_a
  # Ruby 2.7: NoMethodError (undefined method `each2' for 1..8:Range) -- even though Range includes Enumerable
  # Ruby 3.0: [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]]
  ```
* **Follow-ups:** In Ruby 3.1, `#prepend` behavior [got adjusted again](3.1.html#moduleprepend-behavior-change) to be more predictable.

#### Improved method visibility declaration[](#improved-method-visibility-declaration)

`private attr_reader :a, :b, :c` and `private alias_method :foo, :bar` now work exactly like one might expect.

* **Changed behaviors:**
  * `Module#public`, `#private`, `#protected` can now accept an array. While it is not necessary when a literal list of symbols is passed, it is more convenient when the method names are calculated by some DSL method.
  * `Module#attr_accessor`, `#attr_reader`, `#attr_writer` now return arrays of symbols with new methods names defined.
  * `Module#alias_method` now returns a name of the method defined.
* **Documentation:**
  * <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Module.html#method-i-private"><code>Module#private</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Module.html#method-i-public"><code>Module#public</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Module.html#method-i-protected"><code>Module#protected</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Module.html#method-i-public_class_emethod"><code>Module#public_class_method</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Module.html#method-i-private_class_method"><code>Module#private_class_method</code></a> are accepting arrays;

  * <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Module.html#method-i-alias_method"><code>Module#alias_method</code></a> returns the name of created method;
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17314">Feature #17314</a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  class A
    def foo
    end

    def bar
    end

    # new behavior of private
    private %i[foo bar]
    # Ruby 2.7: [:foo, :bar] is not a symbol nor a string
    # Ruby 3.0: works

    # old behavior still works
    private :foo, :bar

    # new behavior of attr_XX
    p(attr_reader :a, :b)
    # Ruby 2.7: => nil
    # Ruby 3.0: => [:a, :b]

    # new behavior of alias_method
    p(alias_method :baz, :foo)
    # Ruby 2.7: => A
    # Ruby 3.0: => :bar

    # The consequence is this is now possible:
    private attr_reader :first, :second
    # attr_reader() returns array [:first, :second], which is then passed to private()

    private alias_method :third, :second
    # alias_method() returns :third, which is then passed to private()
  end
  ```
* **Note:** Unlike `alias_method`, `alias` is not a method but a language construct, and its behavior haven't changed (and it can't be used in an expression context):
  ```ruby
    class A
      def foo
      end

      private alias bar foo
      #       ^ syntax error, unexpected `alias'
    end
  ```
* **Follow-up:** In Ruby 3.1, `#private`, `#protected`, `#public`, and `#module_function` [started to return their arguments](3.1.html#moduleprivate-public-protected-and-module_function-return-their-arguments) for better macros chainability.

### `Warning#warn`: `category:` keyword argument.[](#warningwarn-category-keyword-argument)

Ruby 2.7 introduced [warning categories](2.7.html#warning-and-), and allowed to selectively suppress them with `Warning[]=` method. Since Ruby 3.0, user code also may specify categories for its warnings, and intercept them by redefining `Warning.warn`.

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17122">Feature #17122</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Warning.html#method-i-warn"><code>Warning#warn</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Kernel.html#method-i-warn"><code>Kernel#warn</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  # Using from user code:
  Warning[:deprecated] = true
  warn('my warning', category: :deprecated)
  # "my warning"
  Warning[:deprecated] = false
  warn('my warning', category: :deprecated)
  # ...nothing, obeys "don't show deprecated" setting

  # If the category is not supported:
  warn('my warning', category: :custom)
  # ArgumentError (invalid warning category used: custom)

  # Intercepting:
  module Warning
    def self.warn(msg, category: nil)
      puts "Received message #{msg.strip} with category=#{category}"
    end
  end

  Warning[:deprecated] = true
  lambda(&:foo?)
  # Received message 'warn.rb:23: warning: lambda without a literal block is deprecated; use the proc without lambda instead' with category=deprecated

  eval('[1, 2, 3] => [x, *]') # we use eval, otherwise the warning was raised on PARSING stage, before any redefinitions
  # Received message '(eval):1: warning: One-line pattern matching is experimental, and the behavior may change in future versions of Ruby!' with category=experimental
  ```

### Exception output order is changed -- again[](#exception-output-order-is-changed----again)

The "reverse" order of the backtrace (call stack printed starting from the outermost layer, and the innermost is at the bottom), which was introduced in [2.5](2.5.html#backtrace-and-error-message-in-reverse-order) as "experimental", tweaked to be active only for `STDERR` on [2.6](2.6.html#exception-output-tweaking), now it is reverted to the old (pre-2.5) behavior.

* **Reason:** "From the outer to the inner" order is the default for some other languages (like Python), but it seems most of the rubyists never got used to it.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/8661">Feature #8661</a> (the whole history of the "backtrace reversing" initiative, with all the turns)
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  def inner
    raise 'test'
  end

  def outer
    inner
  end

  outer
  ```
  This prints on Ruby 2.5-2.7:
  ```
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    2: from test.rb:9:in `<main>'
    1: from test.rb:6:in `outer'
  test.rb:2:in `inner': test (RuntimeError)
  ```
  But on Ruby < 2.5, and on 3.0 again:
  ```
  test.rb:2:in `inner': test (RuntimeError)
    from test.rb:6:in `outer'
    from test.rb:9:in `<main>'
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * While redesigning the backtrace, command-line option `--backtrace-limit=<number-of-entries>` was introduced, so, you can run the example above this way to partially suppress backtrace:
    ```
    $ ruby --backtrace-limit=0 test.rb
    test.rb:2:in `inner': test (RuntimeError)
       ... 2 levels...
    ```

### Strings and symbols[](#strings-and-symbols)

#### Interpolated String literals are no longer frozen when `# frozen-string-literal: true` is used[](#interpolated-string-literals-are-no-longer-frozen-when--frozen-string-literal-true-is-used)

* **Reason:** The idea of `frozen-string-literal` pragma is to avoid unnecessary allocations, when the same `"string"` repeated in the code called multiple times; but if the string is constructed dynamically with interpolation, there would be no point (it is hard to predict that allocations would be avoided, as the string can be different each time); it also breaks the "intuitive" feeling that the string is dynamic.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17104">Feature #17104</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/syntax/comments_rdoc.html#label-frozen_string_literal+Directive"><code>doc/syntax/comments.rdoc</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  # frozen-string-literal: true

  def render(title, body)
    result = "## #{title}"
    result << "\n"
    result << body
  end

  puts render('The Title', 'The body')
  # Ruby 2.7: in `render': can't modify frozen String (FrozenError)
  # Ruby 3.0:
  #   ## The Title
  #   The body
  ```

#### `String`: always returning `String`[](#string-always-returning-string)

On custom classes inherited from `String`, some methods previously were returning an instance of this class, and others returned `String`. Now they all do the latter.

* **Reason:** While one might argue that `MyCoolString.new(" foo ").strip` should return an instance of `MyCoolString`, it actually creates a significant problem: String internals don't know how to construct a new instance of the child class (imagine it has a constructor like `StringFromFile.new(content, filename:)`), and in Ruby versions before 3.0 they didn't actually construct child classes with the constructor. It was a source of all kinds of subtle bugs.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker bug" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/10845">Bug #10845</a>
* **Affected methods:** `#*`, `#capitalize`, `#center`, `#chomp`, `#chop`, `#delete`, `#delete_prefix`, `#delete_suffix`, `#downcase`, `#dump`, `#each_char`, `#each_grapheme_cluster`, `#each_line`, `#gsub`, `#ljust`, `#lstrip`, `#partition`, `#reverse`, `#rjust`, `#rpartition`, `#rstrip`, `#scrub`, `#slice!`, `#slice` / `#[]`, `#split`, `#squeeze`, `#strip`, `#sub`, `#succ` / `#next`, `#swapcase`, `#tr`, `#tr_s`, `#upcase`
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  class Buffer < String
    attr_reader :capacity

    def initialize(content, capacity:)
      super(content)
      @capacity = capacity
    end

    # some impl.
  end

  stripped = Buffer.new(' foo ', capacity: 100).strip
  stripped.class
  # Ruby 2.7: Buffer
  # Ruby 3.0: String
  stripped.capacity
  # Ruby 2.7: nil -- one might ask "why it haven't been copied from parent???"
  # Ruby 3.0: NoMethodError (undefined method `capacity' for "foo":String)
  ```
* **Note:** The same change was implemented for [Array](#array-always-returning-array).

#### `Symbol#name`[](#symbolname)

The method returns a frozen string with the symbol's representation.

* **Reason:** Producing non-frozen strings from `Symbol#to_s` might lead to a memory/performance overhead, for example, when large data structures are serialized. It was discussed that `#to_s` should be changed to just return a frozen String, but it would create a backward compatibility problem in code looking like this:
  ```ruby
  # Not the best, but existing in the wild way of constructing strings from data containing symbols
  {some: 'data'}.map { |k, v| k.to_s << ': ' << v }.join(', ')
  # If k.to_s returns a frozen string, it would throw FrozenError (can't modify frozen String: "some")
  ```
  as a compromise, a new method was added.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16150">Feature #16150</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Symbol.html#method-i-name"><code>Symbol#name</code></a>

### Collections[](#collections)

#### `Array`: always returning `Array`[](#array-always-returning-array)

On custom classes inherited from `Array`, some methods previously were returning an instance of this class, and others returned `Array`. Now they all do the latter.

* **Reason:** See above, where the same changes for [String](#string-always-returning-string) are explained.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker bug" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/6087">Bug #6087</a>
* **Affected methods:** `#*`, `#drop`, `#drop_while`, `#flatten`, `#slice!`, `#slice` / `#[]`, `#take`, `#take_while`, `#uniq`
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  class Nodes < Array
    attr_reader :parent
    def initialize(nodes, parent)
      super(nodes)
      @parent = parent
    end

    # some impl.
  end

  uniq = Nodes.new(['<tr>Name</tr>', '<tr>Position</tr>', '<tr>Name</tr>'], 'table').uniq
  uniq.class
  # Ruby 2.7: Nodes
  # Ruby 3.0: Array
  uniq.parent
  # Ruby 2.7: nil -- one might ask "why it haven't been copied from parent???"
  # Ruby 3.0: NoMethodError (undefined method `uniq' for ["<tr>Name</tr>", "<tr>Position</tr>"]:Array)
  ```

#### `Array`: slicing with `Enumerator::ArithmeticSequence`[](#array-slicing-with-enumeratorarithmeticsequence)

`Enumerator::ArithmeticSequence` was [introduced in 2.6](2.6.html#enumeratorarithmeticsequence) as an concept representing "sequence from `b` to `e` with step `s`". Since 3.0, `Array#[]` and `Array#slice` accept arithmetic sequence as a slicing argument.

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16812">Feature #16812</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Array.html#method-i-5B-5D"><code>Array#[]</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  text_data = ['---', 'Jane', '---', 'John', '---', 'Yatsuke', '---']
  text_data[(1..) % 2] # each second element
  # => ["Jane", "John", "Yatsuke"]

  # Note that unlike slicing with Range, slicing with ArithmeticSequence might raise RangeError:
  text_data[0..100]
  # => ["---", "Jane", "---", "John", "---", "Yatsuke", "---"]
  text_data[(0..100) % 2]
  # RangeError (((0..100).%(2)) out of range)
  ```
* **Notes:** Don't forget to put `()` around range: without them, `0..100 % 2` is actually `(0)..(100 % 2)`, e.g. `0..0`.

#### `Hash#except`[](#hashexcept)

* **Reason:** `Hash#slice` ("only selected set of keys") was added in [Ruby 2.5](2.5.html#hashslice), but `Hash#except` was missing at this point. Added for completeness, and because it has lot of pragmatic usages.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15822">Feature #15822</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Hash.html#method-i-except"><code>Hash#except</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/ENV.html#method-c-except"><code>ENV.except</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  h = {a: 1, b: 2}
  h.except(:b)
  # => {:a=>1}
  h.except(:c)        # unknown key is not an error
  # => {:a=>1, :b=>2}
  ```
* **Note:** Unlike ActiveSupport, there's no `Hash#except!` (like there is no `#slice!`)

#### `Hash#transform_keys`: argument for key renaming[](#hashtransform_keys-argument-for-key-renaming)

`Hash#transform_keys(from: to)` allows to rename keys in a DRY way.

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16274">Feature #16274</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Hash.html#method-i-transform_keys"><code>Hash#transform_keys</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  h = {name: 'Ruby', years: 25}
  h.transform_keys(name: :title, years: :age)
  # => {:title=>"Ruby", :age=>25}
  h.transform_keys(name: :title, site: :url)
  # => {:title=>"Ruby", :years=>25} -- not mentioned keys are copied as is, unknown keys ignored
  h.transform_keys(years: :name, name: :title)
  # => {:title=>"Ruby", :name=>25} -- note that the first rename wouldn't replace the :name key, because
  #                                   first all renames are deduced, and then applied
  h.transform_keys(name: :lang_name) { |k| :"meta_#{k}" }
  # => {:lang_name=>"Ruby", :meta_years=>25} -- block, if passed, is used to process keys the hash doesn't mention

  h.transform_keys!(name: :title, years: :age) # bang version works, too
  h
  # => {:title=>"Ruby", :age=>25}
  ```

#### `Hash#each` consistently yields a 2-element array to lambdas[](#hasheach-consistently-yields-a-2-element-array-to-lambdas)

Just fixes an inconsistency introduced by optimization many versions ago.

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker bug" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12706">Bug #12706</a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  {a: 1}.each(&->(pair) { puts "pair=#{pair}" })
  # 2.7 and 3.0: pair=[:a, 1] -- so, it is "yield 2 items as one argument"
  {a: 1}.each(&->(pair, redundant) { puts "pair=#{pair}, redudnant=#{redundant}" })
  # 2.7: pair=a, redudnant=1 -- arguments accidentally behave like for regular proc (auto-unpacking)
  # 3.0: ArgumentError (wrong number of arguments (given 1, expected 2)) -- no unexpected auto-unpacking
  ```

### Procs/lambdas[](#procslambdas)

#### `Symbol#to_proc` reported as lambda[](#symbolto_proc-reported-as-lambda)

* **Reason:** It was noted that the result of `&:something` behaves like a lambda, but its introspection methods are misleadingly reported it as a regular proc. While no big offense, it can be inconvenient when learning, and produce subtle bugs in complicated metaprogramming.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16260">Feature #16260</a>
* **Documentation:** —
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  def test_it(&block)
    p [block.lambda?, block.parameters]
  end

  # Regular proc
  test_it { |x| x.size }      # => [false, [[:opt, :x]]]
  # Regular lambda
  test_it(&->(x) { x.size })  # => [true, [[:req, :x]]]
  # Symbol proc
  test_it(&:size)
  # Ruby 2.7: [false, [[:rest]]]
  # Ruby 3.0: [true, [[:req], [:rest]]]
  ```
  The second one is more true, because it behaves like lambda: doesn't auto-unpack parameters, and
  requires the first one:
  ```ruby
  Warning[:deprecated] = true
  proc { |x, y| x + y }.call([1, 2])    # => 3, parameters unpacked
  proc { |x| x.inspect }.call           # => "nil", no error, parameter is optional
  lambda { |x, y| x + y }.call([1, 2])  # ArgumentError (wrong number of arguments (given 1, expected 2))
  lambda { |x| x.inspect }.call         # ArgumentError (wrong number of arguments (given 0, expected 1))
  :+.to_proc.call([1, 2])               # ArgumentError (wrong number of arguments (given 0, expected 1))
  :inspect.to_proc.call                 # ArgumentError (no receiver given)
  ```
  Note that the last two errors was raised even on Ruby 2.7, so the behavior is not changed, just introspection made consistent.

#### `Kernel#lambda` warns if called without a literal block[](#kernellambda-warns-if-called-without-a-literal-block)

* **Reason:** One might expect that `lambda(&other_block)` will change block's "lambdiness". It is not true, and it was decided that this behavior shouldn't change. Instead, to avoid errors, this code now warns.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15973">Feature #15973</a>
* **Documentation:** —
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  block = proc { |x| p x }
  processed = lambda(&block)
  # On 3.0: warning: lambda without a literal block is deprecated; use the proc without lambda instead
  processed.lambda? # => false
  processed.call    # => "nil", it is really still not a lambda
  ```

#### `Proc#==` and `#eql?`[](#proc-and-eql)

The method will return true for separate Proc instances if the procs were created from the same block.

* **Reason:** Lazy Proc allocation optimization (not creating `Proc` object while just propagating `&block` further) introduced an inconvenience for some DSL libraries when what are "logically" two references to the same proc, would become two unrelated objects, which could lead to subtle bugs.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14267">Feature #14267</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Proc.html#method-i-3D-3D"><code>Proc#==</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  class SomeDSL
    attr_reader :before_block, :after_block

    def before(&block)
      @before_block = block
    end

    def after(&block)
      @after_block = block
    end

    def before_and_after(&block)
      before(&block)
      after(&block)
    end

    def before_and_after_are_same?
      @before_block == @after_block
    end
  end

  dsl = SomeDSL.new
  dsl.before_and_after { 'some code' }
  dsl.before_block.object_id == dsl.after_block.object_id
  # => true on Ruby 2.4: they were converted to Proc object in #before_and_after, and then this
  #    object was propagated to #before/#after
  # => false on Ruby 2.5-3.0: block was propagated without converting to object, and converts to
  #    two different objects in #before/#after while storing in variables
  p dsl.before_and_after_are_same?
  # => true on Ruby 2.4, because it is the same object
  # => false on Ruby 2.5-2.7
  # => true on 3.0: the objects ARE different, but == implemented the way that they are equal if
  #    they are produced from exactly the same block
  ```

### `Random::DEFAULT` behavior change[](#randomdefault-behavior-change)

`Random::DEFAULT` was an instance of the `Random` class, used by `Random.rand`/`Kernel.rand`. The object was removed, and now `Random::DEFAULT` is just an alias for `Random` class itself (it has class-level methods same as instance-level methods), and `Random.rand` creates a new random generator implicitly _per ractor_, on the first call in that ractor.

* **Reason:** With the introduction of the [Ractors](#ractors), global mutable objects can't be used, and `Random::DEFAULT` was such object (its state have changed with each `#rand` call); so now the default random generator is ractor-local, and is not exposed as a constant (it is decided that it would be too confusing to have a constant with the value different in each ractor).
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17322">Feature #17322</a> (`Random::DEFAULT` becomes the synonym of `Random`), <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17351">Feature #17351</a> (deprecating the constant).
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Random.html"><code>Random</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  Warning[:deprecated] = true
  Random::DEFAULT
  # Ruby 2.7: => #<Random:0x005587d09fba20>
  # Ruby 3.0:
  #   warning: constant Random::DEFAULT is deprecated
  #   => Random -- just the same class

  Random.seed
  # Ruby 2.7: NoMethodError: undefined method `seed' for Random:Class
  # Ruby 3.0: => 77406376310392739943146667089721213130

  # Seed is delegated to (now internal) per-Ractor random object, which is always the same in the same ractor
  10.times.map { Random.seed }.uniq
  # => [77406376310392739943146667089721213130]

  # It is different in another ractor
  Ractor.new { p Random.seed }
  # => 95097031741178961937025250800360539515
  ```
* **Notes:**
  * See [Ractors](#ractors) explanation below, and <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Ractor.html"><code>Ractor</code></a> class docs for deeper understanding of ractors data sharing model.
* **Follow-up:** In 3.2, the constant was [removed](3.2.html#removals).

### Filesystem and IO[](#filesystem-and-io)

#### `Dir.glob` and `Dir.[]` result sorting[](#dirglob-and-dir-result-sorting)

By default the results are sorted, which can be turned off with `sorted: false`

* **Reason:** `Dir.glob` historically returns the results in the same order the underlying OS API does it (which is undefined on Linux). While it can be argued as "natural" (do what the OS does), it is inconvenient for most of the cases; and most of other languages and tools switched to sorting in the last years.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/8709">Feature #8709</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Dir.html#method-c-glob"><code>Dir.glob</code></a>
* **Note:** `Dir.glob('pattern', sort: false)` allows to return results in old (system) order; this might be useful when testing some OS behavior.

### Concurrency[](#concurrency)

#### Ractors[](#ractors)

A long-anticipated concurrency improvement landed in Ruby 3.0. **Ractors** (at some point known as _Guilds_) are fully-isolated (without sharing GVL on CRuby) alternative to threads. To achieve thread-safety without global locking, ractors, in general, can't access each other's (or main program/main ractor) data. To share data with each other, ractors rely on message passing/receiving mechanism, aka actor model (hence the name). The feature was in design and implementation for a long time, so we'll not try to discuss it here in details or link to some "main" discussion, just provide a simple example and links for further investigation.

* **Code:**
  The simplistic example of ractors in action (classic "server-client" ping-pong):
  ```ruby
  server = Ractor.new do
    puts "Server starts: #{self.inspect}"
    puts "Server sends: ping"
    Ractor.yield 'ping'                       # The server doesn't know the receiver and sends to whoever interested
    received = Ractor.receive                 # The server doesn't know the sender and receives from whoever sent
    puts "Server received: #{received}"
  end

  client = Ractor.new(server) do |srv|        # The server ractor is passed to client, and available as srv
    puts "Client starts: #{self.inspect}"
    received = srv.take                       # The Client takes a message specifically from the server
    puts "Client received from " \
         "#{srv.inspect}: #{received}"
    puts "Client sends to " \
         "#{srv.inspect}: pong"
    srv.send 'pong'                           # The client sends a message specifically to the server
  end

  [client, server].each(&:take)               # Wait till they both finish
  ```
  This will output:

  ```
  Server starts: #<Ractor:#2 test.rb:1 running>
  Server sends: ping
  Client starts: #<Ractor:#3 test.rb:8 running>
  Client received from #<Ractor:#2 rac.rb:1 blocking>: ping
  Client sends to #<Ractor:#2 rac.rb:1 blocking>: pong
  Server received: pong
  ```
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Ractor.html"><code>Ractor</code></a> (class documentation), <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/doc/ractor_md.html"><code>doc/ractor.md</code></a> (design documentation).
* **Follow-up:** In Ruby 3.1, ractor's concept of what's allowed to share [was adjusted](3.1.html#ractors-can-access-module-instance-variables) to include shareable class/module instance variables. Ractors are still considered experimental though.

#### Non-blocking `Fiber` and scheduler[](#non-blocking-fiber-and-scheduler)

The improvement of inter-thread concurrency for IO-heavy tasks is achieved with **non-blocking Fibers**. When several long I/O operations should be performed, they can be put in separate _non-blocking_ Fibers, and instead of blocking each other while waiting, they would be transferring the control to the fiber that can proceed, while others wait.

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16786">Feature #16786</a>, <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16792">Feature #16792</a> (Mutex belonging to Fiber)
* **New and updated methods:**
  * `Fiber`: <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Fiber.html#method-c-set_scheduler"><code>Fiber.set_scheduler</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Fiber.html#method-c-scheduler"><code>Fiber.scheduler</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Fiber.html#method-c-new"><code>Fiber.new</code></a> `(blocking: true/false)` parameter, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Fiber.html#method-i-blocking-3F"><code>Fiber#blocking?</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Fiber.html#method-c-blocking-3F"><code>Fiber.blocking?</code></a>
  * Methods invoking scheduler: `Kernel.sleep`, `IO#wait_readable`, `IO#wait_writable`, `IO#read`, `IO#write` and other related methods (e.g. `IO#puts`, `IO#gets`), `Thread#join`, `ConditionVariable#wait`, `Queue#pop`, `SizedQueue#push`;
  * `IO#nonblock?` now defaults to `true`;
  * `Mutex` belongs to `Fiber` rather than `Thread` (can be unlocked from other fiber than the one that locked it).
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Fiber.html#class-Fiber-label-Non-blocking+Fibers"><code>Fiber</code></a> (class documentation), <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Fiber/SchedulerInterface.html"><code>Fiber::SchedulerInterface</code></a> (definition of the interface which the scheduler must implement, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/doc/fiber_md.html"><code>doc/fiber.md</code></a> (design documentation).
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  require 'net/http'

  start = Time.now

  Thread.new do # in this thread, we'll have non-blocking fibers
    Fiber.set_scheduler Scheduler.new # see Notes about the scheduler implementation

    %w[2.6 2.7 3.0].each do |version|
      Fiber.schedule do # Runs block of code in a separate Fiber
        t = Time.now
        # Instead of blocking while the response will be ready, the Fiber will invoke scheduler
        # to add itself to the list of waiting fibers and transfer control to other fibers
        Net::HTTP.get('rubyreferences.github.io', "/rubychanges/#{version}.html")
        puts '%s: finished in %.3f' % [version, Time.now - t]
      end
    end
  end.join # At the END of the thread code, Scheduler will be called to dispatch all waiting fibers
           # in a non-blocking manner

  puts 'Total: finished in %.3f' % (Time.now - start)
  # Prints:
  #  2.6: finished in 0.139
  #  2.7: finished in 0.141
  #  3.0: finished in 0.143
  #  Total: finished in 0.146
  ```
  Note that "total" is lower than sum of all fibers execution time: on `HTTP.get`, instead
  of blocking the whole thread, they were transferring control while waiting, and all three waits are
  performed in parallel.
* **Notes:** The feature is somewhat unprecedented for Ruby in the fact that **no default Scheduler implementation** is provided. Implementing the Scheduler in a reliable way (probably using some additional non-blocking event loop library) is completely up to the user. Considering that the feature is implemented by [Samuel Williams](https://github.com/ioquatix) of the <a class="github" href="https://github.com/socketry/async">Async</a> fame, the Async gem <a class="github" href="https://github.com/socketry/async/blob/master/lib/async/scheduler.rb">utilizes</a> the new feature since the day of 3.0 release.
* **Follow-up:s**
  * In Ruby 3.1, [more scheduler hooks were added](3.1.html#fiber-scheduler-new-hooks) to make more core methods support asynchronous execution;
  * In 3.2, [even more](3.2.html#fiberschedulerio_select) hooks were added, and `SchedulerInteface` documentation abstraction was renamed to `Scheduler`.

#### `Thread.ignore_deadlock` accessor[](#threadignore_deadlock-accessor)

Disabling the default deadlock detection, allowing the use of signal handlers to break deadlock.

* **Reason:** The change helps with rare condition when Ruby's internal deadlock detector is fooled by external signals.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker bug" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13768">Bug #13768</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Thread.html#method-c-ignore_deadlock-3D"><code>Thread.ignore_deadlock=</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Thread.html#method-c-ignore_deadlock"><code>Thread.ignore_deadlock</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  queue1 = Queue.new
  queue2 = Queue.new

  trap(:SIGCHLD) { queue1.push 'from SIGCHLD to queue1' }

  Thread.start { Process.spawn("/bin/sleep 1") }
  Thread.start { queue2.push("via Thread to queue2: #{queue1.pop}") }

  Thread.ignore_deadlock = true # <== New feature

  # Here the message would be received when the childprocess will finish, send message to queue1,
  # which then will be caught in the thread and sent to queue2.
  puts queue2.pop
  # Prints: "via Thread to queue2: from SIGCHLD to queue1"
  #
  # But Without the marked line, it will be printed instead:
  #  in `pop': No live threads left. Deadlock? (fatal)
  #  ... description of sleeping threads ...
  ```

#### `Fiber#backtrace` & `#backtrace_locations`[](#fiberbacktrace--backtrace_locations)

Like similar methods of the `Thread`, provides a locations of the currently executed Fiber code.

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16815">Feature #16815</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Fiber.html#method-i-backtrace"><code>Fiber#backtrace</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Fiber.html#method-i-backtrace_locations"><code>Fiber#backtrace_locations</code></a>,
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  f = Fiber.new { Fiber.yield }
  # When fiber is not yet running, the backtrace is empty
  f.backtrace
  # => []

  # When fiber was resumed, and then yielded control, you can ask about its location
  f.resume
  f.backtrace
  # => ["test.rb:1:in `yield'", "fbr.rb:1:in `block in <main>'"]

  f.backtrace_locations
  # => ["fbr.rb:1:in `yield'", "fbr.rb:1:in `block in <main>'"]
  # Despite looking the same, backtrace_locations are actually instances of Thread::Backtrace::Location
  loc = f.backtrace_locations.first
  loc.label   # => "yield"
  loc.path    # => "test.rb"
  loc.line    # => 1

  # Like Thread.backtrace_locations, the method accepts arguments:
  f.backtrace_locations(1) # start from 1
  # => ["fbr.rb:1:in `block in <main>'"]
  f.backtrace_locations(0, 1) # start from 0, take 1
  # => ["test.rb:1:in `yield'"]
  f.backtrace_locations(0...1) # ranges are acceptable, too
  # => ["test.rb:1:in `yield'"]

  f.resume
  # When the fiber is finished, there is no location
  f.backtrace_locations
  # => nil
  ```

#### `Fiber#transfer` limitations changed[](#fibertransfer-limitations-changed)

`#transfer` is the method that allows fiber to pass control to other fiber directly, allowing several fibers to control each other, creating arbitrary directed graph of control. Two styles of passing control (`Fiber.yield` / `Fiber#resume` vs `Fiber#transfer` to and from fiber) can't be freely mixed: the way in which fiber lost control should be the same it received the control back. In 2.7, this was implemented by a strict rule: once the fiber received control via `#transfer`, it can _never_ return back to `.yield`/`#resume` style. But in 3.0, better grained set of limitations was designed, so when the Fiber passed control via `#transfer` and then received it back (via `#transfer` in other fiber), it again can `.yield` and be `#resume`d.

* **Reason:** The new design makes the "entry point" fiber of `#transfer` graph accessible from outside the graph.
* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker bug" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17221">Bug #17221</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Fiber.html#method-i-transfer"><code>Fiber#transfer</code></a>
* **Code:**
  ```ruby
  require 'fiber'

  manager = nil # For local var to be visible inside worker block

  # This fiber would be started with transfer
  # It can't yield, and can't be resumed
  worker = Fiber.new { |work|
    puts "Worker: starts"
    puts "Worker: Performed #{work.inspect}, transferring back"
    # Fiber.yield     # this would raise FiberError: attempt to yield on a not resumed fiber
    # manager.resume  # this would raise FiberError: attempt to resume a resumed fiber (double resume)
    manager.transfer(work.capitalize)
  }

  # This fiber would be started with resume
  # It can yield or transfer, and can be transferred
  # back or resumed
  manager = Fiber.new {
    puts "Manager: starts"
    puts "Manager: transferring 'something' to worker"
    result = worker.transfer('something')
    puts "Manager: worker returned #{result.inspect}"
    # worker.resume    # this would raise FiberError: attempt to resume a transferring fiber
    Fiber.yield        # this is OK __since 3.0__, the fiber transferred back and from, now it can yield
    puts "Manager: finished"
  }

  puts "Starting the manager"
  manager.resume
  puts "Resuming the manager"
  # manager.transfer  # this would raise FiberError: attempt to transfer to a yielding fiber
  manager.resume # This is possible __since 3.0__
  ```
  This prints:
  ```
  Starting the manager
  Manager: starts
  Manager: transferring 'something' to worker
  Worker: starts
  Worker: Performed "something", transferring back
  Manager: worker returned "Something"
  Resuming the manager
  Manager: finished
  ```
  Before Ruby 3.0, `manager` Fiber (once it ran the loop of `transfer`s with `worker`), had no way to return control generically, to whatever other Fiber wants to run.
* **Notes:** The full list of the new rules are:
  * Can't `transfer` to the fiber resumed (e.g. at currently running due to receiving control via `resume`, and not `transfer`)
  * Can't `transfer` to the fiber yielding (e.g. the one that run `Fiber.yield` and is waiting to be `resume`d)
  * Can't `resume` the fiber transferred (e.g. once the fiber `transfer` to some other fiber, it can obtain the control back only via `transfer`)
  * Can't `Fiber.yield` from the fiber that was never resumed (e.g. that was started due to `transfer`)

### Internals[](#internals)

#### `GC.auto_compact` accessor[](#gcauto_compact-accessor)

Setter/getter for the option to run `GC.compact` (introduced in Ruby 2.7) on each major garbage collection. `false` by default.

* **Discussion:** <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17176">Feature #17176</a>
* **Documentation:** <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/GC.html#method-c-auto_compact"><code>GC.auto_compact</code></a>, <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/GC.html#method-c-auto_compact-3D"><code>GC.auto_compact=</code></a>
* **Notes:** It is noticed by feature authors that currently compaction adds a significant overhead to the garbage collection, so should be tested if that's what you want.


## Standard library[](#standard-library)

* `Set`: as parts of ongoing "Sets: need ♥️" initiative (<a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16989">Feature #16989</a>), some adjustments were made:
  * `SortedSet` has been removed for dependency and performance reasons (it silently depended upon `rbtree` gem).
  * <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Set.html#method-i-join"><code>Set#join</code></a> is added as a shorthand for `.to_a.join`. Discussion: <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16991">Feature #16991</a>.
  * <a class="ruby-doc" href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/Set.html#method-i-3C-3D-3E"><code>Set#<=></code></a>: returns `-1`/`+1` if one set is the proper sub-/super-set of the other, `0` if they are equal, and `nil` otherwise:
    ```ruby
    Set[1, 2, 3] <=> Set[2, 3] # => 1
    Set[1, 2, 3] <=> Set[3, 4] # => nil

    # Note that atomic comparison operators already worked in 2.7 and earlier:
    Set[1, 2, 3] > Set[2, 3] # => true

    # But the new operator allows, for example, sorting of sub/super-sets:
    [Set[1, 2, 3], Set[1, 2]].sort
    # 2.7: ArgumentError (comparison of Set with Set failed)
    # 3.0: => [#<Set: {1, 2}>, #<Set: {1, 2, 3}>]
    ```
    Discussion: <a class="tracker feature" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16995">Feature #16995</a>.

#### Libraries excluded from the standard library[](#libraries-excluded-from-the-standard-library)

Unsupported and lesser used libraries removed from the standard library, and now can be installed as a separate gems.

* <a class="github" href="https://github.com/ruby/net-telnet">net-telnet</a> (was a bundled gem)
* <a class="github" href="https://github.com/ruby/xmlrpc">xmlrpc</a> (was a bundled gem)
* <a class="github" href="https://github.com/ruby/sdbm">SDBM</a>. Discussion: <a class="tracker bug" href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/8446">Bug #8446</a>
* **<a class="github" href="https://github.com/ruby/webrick">WEBrick</a>**. While having a simple webserver in the standard distribution can be considered a good thing (one can show "...and start a web server..." in some very basic Ruby tutorial), WEBrick was a huge maintenance burden, mainly due to the potential security issues. While nobody is advised to use WEBrick in production, any public report about its security issue was registered as a _security issue in Ruby_, requiring immediate attention to maintain Ruby's reputation. And with RubyGems system in place, any tutorial as easy might advise to install any server it considers suitable.
